book one 1805





chapter i

 well prince so genoa and lucca are now just family estates of the
buonapartes but i warn you if you don t tell me that this means war 
if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that
antichrist i really believe he is antichrist i will have nothing
more to do with you and you are no longer my friend no longer my
 faithful slave as you call yourself but how do you do i see i
have frightened you sit down and tell me all the news 

it was in july 1805 and the speaker was the well known anna p vlovna
sch rer maid of honor and favorite of the empress m rya f dorovna 
with these words she greeted prince vas li kur gin a man of high
rank and importance who was the first to arrive at her reception anna
p vlovna had had a cough for some days she was as she said suffering
from la grippe grippe being then a new word in st petersburg used
only by the elite 

all her invitations without exception written in french and delivered
by a scarlet liveried footman that morning ran as follows 

 if you have nothing better to do count or prince and if the
prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible 
i shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10 annette
sch rer 

 heavens what a virulent attack replied the prince not in the
least disconcerted by this reception he had just entered wearing an
embroidered court uniform knee breeches and shoes and had stars on
his breast and a serene expression on his flat face he spoke in that
refined french in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought and
with the gentle patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance
who had grown old in society and at court he went up to anna p vlovna 
kissed her hand presenting to her his bald scented and shining head 
and complacently seated himself on the sofa 

 first of all dear friend tell me how you are set your friend s
mind at rest said he without altering his tone beneath the
politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony
could be discerned 

 can one be well while suffering morally can one be calm in times
like these if one has any feeling said anna p vlovna you are
staying the whole evening i hope 

 and the fete at the english ambassador s today is wednesday i
must put in an appearance there said the prince my daughter is
coming for me to take me there 

 i thought today s fete had been canceled i confess all these
festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome 

 if they had known that you wished it the entertainment would have
been put off said the prince who like a wound up clock by force
of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed 

 don t tease well and what has been decided about novos ltsev s
dispatch you know everything 

 what can one say about it replied the prince in a cold listless
tone what has been decided they have decided that buonaparte has
burnt his boats and i believe that we are ready to burn ours 

prince vas li always spoke languidly like an actor repeating a stale
part anna p vlovna sch rer on the contrary despite her forty years 
overflowed with animation and impulsiveness to be an enthusiast had
become her social vocation and sometimes even when she did not
feel like it she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the
expectations of those who knew her the subdued smile which though it
did not suit her faded features always played round her lips expressed 
as in a spoiled child a continual consciousness of her charming defect 
which she neither wished nor could nor considered it necessary to
correct 

in the midst of a conversation on political matters anna p vlovna burst
out 

 oh don t speak to me of austria perhaps i don t understand
things but austria never has wished and does not wish for war she
is betraying us russia alone must save europe our gracious sovereign
recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it that is the one
thing i have faith in our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform
the noblest role on earth and he is so virtuous and noble that god will
not forsake him he will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of
revolution which has become more terrible than ever in the person of
this murderer and villain we alone must avenge the blood of the just
one whom i ask you can we rely on england with her commercial
spirit will not and cannot understand the emperor alexander s
loftiness of soul she has refused to evacuate malta she wanted to
find and still seeks some secret motive in our actions what answer
did novos ltsev get none the english have not understood and cannot
understand the self abnegation of our emperor who wants nothing for
himself but only desires the good of mankind and what have they
promised nothing and what little they have promised they will not
perform prussia has always declared that buonaparte is invincible and
that all europe is powerless before him and i don t believe a
word that hardenburg says or haugwitz either this famous prussian
neutrality is just a trap i have faith only in god and the lofty
destiny of our adored monarch he will save europe 

she suddenly paused smiling at her own impetuosity 

 i think said the prince with a smile that if you had been
sent instead of our dear wintzingerode you would have captured the king
of prussia s consent by assault you are so eloquent will you give me
a cup of tea 

 in a moment propos she added becoming calm again i am
expecting two very interesting men tonight le vicomte de mortemart who
is connected with the montmorencys through the rohans one of the best
french families he is one of the genuine migr s the good ones and
also the abb morio do you know that profound thinker he has been
received by the emperor had you heard 

 i shall be delighted to meet them said the prince but
tell me he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just
occurred to him though the question he was about to ask was the chief
motive of his visit is it true that the dowager empress wants
baron funke to be appointed first secretary at vienna the baron by all
accounts is a poor creature 

prince vas li wished to obtain this post for his son but others were
trying through the dowager empress m rya f dorovna to secure it for
the baron 

anna p vlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor
anyone else had a right to criticize what the empress desired or was
pleased with 

 baron funke has been recommended to the dowager empress by her
sister was all she said in a dry and mournful tone 

as she named the empress anna p vlovna s face suddenly assumed an
expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with
sadness and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious
patroness she added that her majesty had deigned to show baron funke
beaucoup d estime and again her face clouded over with sadness 

the prince was silent and looked indifferent but with the womanly and
courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her anna p vlovna
wished both to rebuke him for daring to speak as he had done of a man
recommended to the empress and at the same time to console him so she
said 

 now about your family do you know that since your daughter came
out everyone has been enraptured by her they say she is amazingly
beautiful 

the prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude 

 i often think she continued after a short pause drawing nearer
to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political
and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate
conversation i often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life
are distributed why has fate given you two such splendid children 
i don t speak of anatole your youngest i don t like him she
added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows 
 two such charming children and really you appreciate them less than
anyone and so you don t deserve to have them 

and she smiled her ecstatic smile 

 i can t help it said the prince lavater would have said i
lack the bump of paternity 

 don t joke i mean to have a serious talk with you do you know
i am dissatisfied with your younger son between ourselves and her
face assumed its melancholy expression he was mentioned at her
majesty s and you were pitied 

the prince answered nothing but she looked at him significantly 
awaiting a reply he frowned 

 what would you have me do he said at last you know i did all
a father could for their education and they have both turned out fools 
hippolyte is at least a quiet fool but anatole is an active one that
is the only difference between them he said this smiling in a way
more natural and animated than usual so that the wrinkles round
his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and
unpleasant 

 and why are children born to such men as you if you were not a
father there would be nothing i could reproach you with said anna
p vlovna looking up pensively 

 i am your faithful slave and to you alone i can confess that my
children are the bane of my life it is the cross i have to bear that
is how i explain it to myself it can t be helped 

he said no more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a
gesture anna p vlovna meditated 

 have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son anatole she
asked they say old maids have a mania for matchmaking and though i
don t feel that weakness in myself as yet i know a little person who
is very unhappy with her father she is a relation of yours princess
mary bolk nskaya 

prince vas li did not reply though with the quickness of memory and
perception befitting a man of the world he indicated by a movement of
the head that he was considering this information 

 do you know he said at last evidently unable to check the sad
current of his thoughts that anatole is costing me forty thousand
rubles a year and he went on after a pause what will it be in
five years if he goes on like this presently he added that s
what we fathers have to put up with is this princess of yours
rich 

 her father is very rich and stingy he lives in the country he is
the well known prince bolk nski who had to retire from the army under
the late emperor and was nicknamed the king of prussia he is
very clever but eccentric and a bore the poor girl is very unhappy 
she has a brother i think you know him he married lise meinen lately 
he is an aide de camp of kut zov s and will be here tonight 

 listen dear annette said the prince suddenly taking anna
p vlovna s hand and for some reason drawing it downwards arrange
that affair for me and i shall always be your most devoted slave slafe
with an f as a village elder of mine writes in his reports she is rich
and of good family and that s all i want 

and with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him he raised the
maid of honor s hand to his lips kissed it and swung it to and fro
as he lay back in his armchair looking in another direction 

 attendez said anna p vlovna reflecting i ll speak to
lise young bolk nski s wife this very evening and perhaps the
thing can be arranged it shall be on your family s behalf that i ll
start my apprenticeship as old maid 





chapter ii

anna p vlovna s drawing room was gradually filling the highest
petersburg society was assembled there people differing widely in age
and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged 
prince vas li s daughter the beautiful h l ne came to take her
father to the ambassador s entertainment she wore a ball dress and
her badge as maid of honor the youthful little princess bolk nskaya 
known as la femme la plus s duisante de p tersbourg was also there 
she had been married during the previous winter and being pregnant did
not go to any large gatherings but only to small receptions prince
vas li s son hippolyte had come with mortemart whom he introduced 
the abb morio and many others had also come 

 the most fascinating woman in petersburg 

to each new arrival anna p vlovna said you have not yet seen my
aunt or you do not know my aunt and very gravely conducted
him or her to a little old lady wearing large bows of ribbon in her
cap who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests
began to arrive and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her
aunt anna p vlovna mentioned each one s name and then left them 

each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not
one of them knew not one of them wanted to know and not one of them
cared about anna p vlovna observed these greetings with mournful and
solemn interest and silent approval the aunt spoke to each of them in
the same words about their health and her own and the health of her
majesty who thank god was better today and each visitor 
though politeness prevented his showing impatience left the old woman
with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not
return to her the whole evening 

the young princess bolk nskaya had brought some work in a
gold embroidered velvet bag her pretty little upper lip on which a
delicate dark down was just perceptible was too short for her teeth 
but it lifted all the more sweetly and was especially charming when she
occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip as is always the case
with a thoroughly attractive woman her defect the shortness of her
upper lip and her half open mouth seemed to be her own special and
peculiar form of beauty everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty
young woman so soon to become a mother so full of life and health and
carrying her burden so lightly old men and dull dispirited young ones
who looked at her after being in her company and talking to her a
little while felt as if they too were becoming like her full of life
and health all who talked to her and at each word saw her bright smile
and the constant gleam of her white teeth thought that they were in a
specially amiable mood that day 

the little princess went round the table with quick short swaying
steps her workbag on her arm and gaily spreading out her dress sat
down on a sofa near the silver samovar as if all she was doing was a
pleasure to herself and to all around her i have brought my work 
said she in french displaying her bag and addressing all present 
 mind annette i hope you have not played a wicked trick on me 
she added turning to her hostess you wrote that it was to be quite
a small reception and just see how badly i am dressed and she
spread out her arms to show her short waisted lace trimmed dainty gray
dress girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast 

 soyez tranquille lise you will always be prettier than anyone
else replied anna p vlovna 

 you know said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in
french turning to a general my husband is deserting me he is going
to get himself killed tell me what this wretched war is for she
added addressing prince vas li and without waiting for an answer she
turned to speak to his daughter the beautiful h l ne 

 what a delightful woman this little princess is said prince
vas li to anna p vlovna 

one of the next arrivals was a stout heavily built young man with
close cropped hair spectacles the light colored breeches fashionable
at that time a very high ruffle and a brown dress coat this stout
young man was an illegitimate son of count bez khov a well known
grandee of catherine s time who now lay dying in moscow the young man
had not yet entered either the military or civil service as he had only
just returned from abroad where he had been educated and this was his
first appearance in society anna p vlovna greeted him with the nod she
accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room but in spite of
this lowest grade greeting a look of anxiety and fear as at the sight
of something too large and unsuited to the place came over her face
when she saw pierre enter though he was certainly rather bigger than
the other men in the room her anxiety could only have reference to
the clever though shy but observant and natural expression which
distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room 

 it is very good of you monsieur pierre to come and visit a poor
invalid said anna p vlovna exchanging an alarmed glance with her
aunt as she conducted him to her 

pierre murmured something unintelligible and continued to look round as
if in search of something on his way to the aunt he bowed to the little
princess with a pleased smile as to an intimate acquaintance 

anna p vlovna s alarm was justified for pierre turned away from the
aunt without waiting to hear her speech about her majesty s health 
anna p vlovna in dismay detained him with the words do you know the
abb morio he is a most interesting man 

 yes i have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace and it is very
interesting but hardly feasible 

 you think so rejoined anna p vlovna in order to say something
and get away to attend to her duties as hostess but pierre now
committed a reverse act of impoliteness first he had left a lady before
she had finished speaking to him and now he continued to speak to
another who wished to get away with his head bent and his big feet
spread apart he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abb s
plan chimerical 

 we will talk of it later said anna p vlovna with a smile 

and having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave she
resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch ready
to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag as
the foreman of a spinning mill when he has set the hands to work goes
round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that
creaks or makes more noise than it should and hastens to check the
machine or set it in proper motion so anna p vlovna moved about her
drawing room approaching now a silent now a too noisy group and by a
word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady 
proper and regular motion but amid these cares her anxiety about
pierre was evident she kept an anxious watch on him when he approached
the group round mortemart to listen to what was being said there and
again when he passed to another group whose center was the abb 

pierre had been educated abroad and this reception at anna
p vlovna s was the first he had attended in russia he knew that all
the intellectual lights of petersburg were gathered there and like a
child in a toyshop did not know which way to look afraid of missing
any clever conversation that was to be heard seeing the self confident
and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always
expecting to hear something very profound at last he came up to morio 
here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an
opportunity to express his own views as young people are fond of doing 





chapter iii

anna p vlovna s reception was in full swing the spindles hummed
steadily and ceaselessly on all sides with the exception of the aunt 
beside whom sat only one elderly lady who with her thin careworn face
was rather out of place in this brilliant society the whole company had
settled into three groups one chiefly masculine had formed round
the abb another of young people was grouped round the beautiful
princess h l ne prince vas li s daughter and the little princess
bolk nskaya very pretty and rosy though rather too plump for her age 
the third group was gathered round mortemart and anna p vlovna 

the vicomte was a nice looking young man with soft features and polished
manners who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of
politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in
which he found himself anna p vlovna was obviously serving him up as
a treat to her guests as a clever ma tre d h tel serves up as a
specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in
the kitchen would have cared to eat so anna p vlovna served up to
her guests first the vicomte and then the abb as peculiarly choice
morsels the group about mortemart immediately began discussing the
murder of the duc d enghien the vicomte said that the duc d enghien
had perished by his own magnanimity and that there were particular
reasons for buonaparte s hatred of him 

 ah yes do tell us all about it vicomte said anna p vlovna 
with a pleasant feeling that there was something la louis xv in the
sound of that sentence contez nous ela vicomte 

the vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to
comply anna p vlovna arranged a group round him inviting everyone to
listen to his tale 

 the vicomte knew the duc personally whispered anna p vlovna to
one of the guests the vicomte is a wonderful raconteur said she
to another how evidently he belongs to the best society said she
to a third and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest
and most advantageous style like a well garnished joint of roast beef
on a hot dish 

the vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile 

 come over here h l ne dear said anna p vlovna to the
beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off the center of
another group 

the princess smiled she rose with the same unchanging smile with which
she had first entered the room the smile of a perfectly beautiful
woman with a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss
and ivy with a gleam of white shoulders glossy hair and sparkling
diamonds she passed between the men who made way for her not looking
at any of them but smiling on all as if graciously allowing each the
privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders 
back and bosom which in the fashion of those days were very much
exposed and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as
she moved toward anna p vlovna h l ne was so lovely that not only
did she not show any trace of coquetry but on the contrary she even
appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty she
seemed to wish but to be unable to diminish its effect 

 how lovely said everyone who saw her and the vicomte lifted his
shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary
when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her
unchanging smile 

 madame i doubt my ability before such an audience said he 
smilingly inclining his head 

the princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered
a reply unnecessary she smilingly waited all the time the story was
being told she sat upright glancing now at her beautiful round arm 
altered in shape by its pressure on the table now at her still more
beautiful bosom on which she readjusted a diamond necklace from time
to time she smoothed the folds of her dress and whenever the story
produced an effect she glanced at anna p vlovna at once adopted just
the expression she saw on the maid of honor s face and again relapsed
into her radiant smile 

the little princess had also left the tea table and followed h l ne 

 wait a moment i ll get my work now then what are you
thinking of she went on turning to prince hippolyte fetch me my
workbag 

there was a general movement as the princess smiling and talking
merrily to everyone at once sat down and gaily arranged herself in her
seat 

 now i am all right she said and asking the vicomte to begin she
took up her work 

prince hippolyte having brought the workbag joined the circle and
moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her 

le charmant hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance
to his beautiful sister but yet more by the fact that in spite of
this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly his features were like his
sister s but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous 
self satisfied youthful and constant smile of animation and by the
wonderful classic beauty of her figure his face on the contrary
was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen
self confidence while his body was thin and weak his eyes nose and
mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant wearied grimace and his arms
and legs always fell into unnatural positions 

 it s not going to be a ghost story said he sitting down beside
the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette as if without this
instrument he could not begin to speak 

 why no my dear fellow said the astonished narrator shrugging
his shoulders 

 because i hate ghost stories said prince hippolyte in a tone
which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he
had uttered them 

he spoke with such self confidence that his hearers could not be sure
whether what he said was very witty or very stupid he was dressed in
a dark green dress coat knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe
effray e as he called it shoes and silk stockings 

the vicomte told his tale very neatly it was an anecdote then current 
to the effect that the duc d enghien had gone secretly to paris to
visit mademoiselle george that at her house he came upon bonaparte 
who also enjoyed the famous actress favors and that in his presence
napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was
subject and was thus at the duc s mercy the latter spared him and
this magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid by death 

the story was very pretty and interesting especially at the point
where the rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladies looked
agitated 

 charming said anna p vlovna with an inquiring glance at the
little princess 

 charming whispered the little princess sticking the needle into
her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story
prevented her from going on with it 

the vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully
prepared to continue but just then anna p vlovna who had kept a
watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her noticed that he was
talking too loudly and vehemently with the abb so she hurried to the
rescue pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abb about
the balance of power and the latter evidently interested by the young
man s simple minded eagerness was explaining his pet theory both
were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally which was why
anna p vlovna disapproved 

 the means are the balance of power in europe and the rights of
the people the abb was saying it is only necessary for one
powerful nation like russia barbaric as she is said to be to place
herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object
the maintenance of the balance of power of europe and it would save the
world 

 but how are you to get that balance pierre was beginning 

at that moment anna p vlovna came up and looking severely at pierre 
asked the italian how he stood russian climate the italian s
face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected sugary
expression evidently habitual to him when conversing with women 

 i am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the
society more especially of the feminine society in which i have had
the honor of being received that i have not yet had time to think of
the climate said he 

not letting the abb and pierre escape anna p vlovna the more
conveniently to keep them under observation brought them into the
larger circle 





chapter iv

just then another visitor entered the drawing room prince andrew
bolk nski the little princess husband he was a very handsome young
man of medium height with firm clearcut features everything about
him from his weary bored expression to his quiet measured step 
offered a most striking contrast to his quiet little wife it was
evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room but had
found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to
them and among all these faces that he found so tedious none seemed
to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife he turned away from
her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face kissed anna
p vlovna s hand and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company 

 you are off to the war prince said anna p vlovna 

 general kut zov said bolk nski speaking french and stressing
the last syllable of the general s name like a frenchman has been
pleased to take me as an aide de camp 

 and lise your wife 

 she will go to the country 

 are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife 

 andr said his wife addressing her husband in the same
coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men the vicomte has
been telling us such a tale about mademoiselle george and buonaparte 

prince andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away pierre who from
the moment prince andrew entered the room had watched him with glad 
affectionate eyes now came up and took his arm before he looked round
prince andrew frowned again expressing his annoyance with whoever was
touching his arm but when he saw pierre s beaming face he gave him an
unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile 

 there now so you too are in the great world said he to
pierre 

 i knew you would be here replied pierre i will come to supper
with you may i he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the
vicomte who was continuing his story 

 no impossible said prince andrew laughing and pressing
pierre s hand to show that there was no need to ask the question he
wished to say something more but at that moment prince vas li and his
daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass 

 you must excuse me dear vicomte said prince vas li to the
frenchman holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent
his rising this unfortunate fete at the ambassador s deprives me
of a pleasure and obliges me to interrupt you i am very sorry to leave
your enchanting party said he turning to anna p vlovna 

his daughter princess h l ne passed between the chairs lightly
holding up the folds of her dress and the smile shone still more
radiantly on her beautiful face pierre gazed at her with rapturous 
almost frightened eyes as she passed him 

 very lovely said prince andrew 

 very said pierre 

in passing prince vas li seized pierre s hand and said to anna
p vlovna educate this bear for me he has been staying with me
a whole month and this is the first time i have seen him in society 
nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever
women 


anna p vlovna smiled and promised to take pierre in hand she knew his
father to be a connection of prince vas li s the elderly lady who
had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook prince
vas li in the anteroom all the affectation of interest she had assumed
had left her kindly and tear worn face and it now expressed only anxiety
and fear 

 how about my son bor s prince said she hurrying after him into
the anteroom i can t remain any longer in petersburg tell me what
news i may take back to my poor boy 

although prince vas li listened reluctantly and not very politely
to the elderly lady even betraying some impatience she gave him an
ingratiating and appealing smile and took his hand that he might not go
away 

 what would it cost you to say a word to the emperor and then he
would be transferred to the guards at once said she 

 believe me princess i am ready to do all i can answered prince
vas li but it is difficult for me to ask the emperor i should
advise you to appeal to rumy ntsev through prince gol tsyn that would
be the best way 

the elderly lady was a princess drubetsk ya belonging to one of the
best families in russia but she was poor and having long been out of
society had lost her former influential connections she had now come to
petersburg to procure an appointment in the guards for her only son 
it was in fact solely to meet prince vas li that she had obtained an
invitation to anna p vlovna s reception and had sat listening to
the vicomte s story prince vas li s words frightened her an
embittered look clouded her once handsome face but only for a moment 
then she smiled again and clutched prince vas li s arm more tightly 

 listen to me prince said she i have never yet asked you
for anything and i never will again nor have i ever reminded you of my
father s friendship for you but now i entreat you for god s sake to
do this for my son and i shall always regard you as a benefactor 
she added hurriedly no don t be angry but promise i have asked
gol tsyn and he has refused be the kindhearted man you always were 
she said trying to smile though tears were in her eyes 

 papa we shall be late said princess h l ne turning her
beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she
stood waiting by the door 

influence in society however is a capital which has to be economized
if it is to last prince vas li knew this and having once realized
that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him he would soon be
unable to ask for himself he became chary of using his influence but
in princess drubetsk ya s case he felt after her second appeal 
something like qualms of conscience she had reminded him of what was
quite true he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in
his career moreover he could see by her manners that she was one of
those women mostly mothers who having once made up their minds 
will not rest until they have gained their end and are prepared if
necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour and even
to make scenes this last consideration moved him 

 my dear anna mikh ylovna said he with his usual familiarity and
weariness of tone it is almost impossible for me to do what you
ask but to prove my devotion to you and how i respect your father s
memory i will do the impossible your son shall be transferred to the
guards here is my hand on it are you satisfied 

 my dear benefactor this is what i expected from you i knew your
kindness he turned to go 

 wait just a word when he has been transferred to the guards 
she faltered you are on good terms with michael ilari novich
kut zov recommend bor s to him as adjutant then i shall be at
rest and then 

prince vas li smiled 

 no i won t promise that you don t know how kut zov is pestered
since his appointment as commander in chief he told me himself that
all the moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as
adjutants 

 no but do promise i won t let you go my dear benefactor 

 papa said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before 
 we shall be late 

 well au revoir good by you hear her 

 then tomorrow you will speak to the emperor 

 certainly but about kut zov i don t promise 

 do promise do promise vas li cried anna mikh ylovna as he
went with the smile of a coquettish girl which at one time probably
came naturally to her but was now very ill suited to her careworn face 

apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed
all the old feminine arts but as soon as the prince had gone her face
resumed its former cold artificial expression she returned to the
group where the vicomte was still talking and again pretended to
listen while waiting till it would be time to leave her task was
accomplished 





chapter v

 and what do you think of this latest comedy the coronation at
milan asked anna p vlovna and of the comedy of the people of
genoa and lucca laying their petitions before monsieur buonaparte and
monsieur buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of
the nations adorable it is enough to make one s head whirl it is as
if the whole world had gone crazy 

prince andrew looked anna p vlovna straight in the face with a
sarcastic smile 

 dieu me la donne gare qui la touche they say he was
very fine when he said that he remarked repeating the words in
italian dio mi l ha dato guai a chi la tocchi 

 god has given it to me let him who touches it beware 

 i hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run
over anna p vlovna continued the sovereigns will not be able to
endure this man who is a menace to everything 

 the sovereigns i do not speak of russia said the vicomte polite
but hopeless the sovereigns madame what have they done for louis
xvii for the queen or for madame elizabeth nothing and he became
more animated and believe me they are reaping the reward of their
betrayal of the bourbon cause the sovereigns why they are sending
ambassadors to compliment the usurper 

and sighing disdainfully he again changed his position 

prince hippolyte who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time
through his lorgnette suddenly turned completely round toward the
little princess and having asked for a needle began tracing the cond 
coat of arms on the table he explained this to her with as much gravity
as if she had asked him to do it 

 b ton de gueules engr l de gueules d azur maison cond 
said he 

the princess listened smiling 

 if buonaparte remains on the throne of france a year longer the
vicomte continued with the air of a man who in a matter with which
he is better acquainted than anyone else does not listen to others but
follows the current of his own thoughts things will have gone too
far by intrigues violence exile and executions french society i
mean good french society will have been forever destroyed and
then 

he shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands pierre wished to
make a remark for the conversation interested him but anna p vlovna 
who had him under observation interrupted 

 the emperor alexander said she with the melancholy which
always accompanied any reference of hers to the imperial family has
declared that he will leave it to the french people themselves to choose
their own form of government and i believe that once free from the
usurper the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms
of its rightful king she concluded trying to be amiable to the
royalist emigrant 

 that is doubtful said prince andrew monsieur le vicomte quite
rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far i think it will
be difficult to return to the old regime 

 from what i have heard said pierre blushing and breaking into
the conversation almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to
bonaparte s side 

 it is the buonapartists who say that replied the vicomte without
looking at pierre at the present time it is difficult to know the
real state of french public opinion 

 bonaparte has said so remarked prince andrew with a sarcastic
smile 

it was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his
remarks at him though without looking at him 

 i showed them the path to glory but they did not follow
it prince andrew continued after a short silence again quoting
napoleon s words i opened my antechambers and they crowded
in i do not know how far he was justified in saying so 

 not in the least replied the vicomte after the murder of the
duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero if to some
people he went on turning to anna p vlovna he ever was a hero 
after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one
hero less on earth 

before anna p vlovna and the others had time to smile their
appreciation of the vicomte s epigram pierre again broke into the
conversation and though anna p vlovna felt sure he would say something
inappropriate she was unable to stop him 

 the execution of the duc d enghien declared monsieur pierre 
 was a political necessity and it seems to me that napoleon
showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole
responsibility of that deed 

 dieu mon dieu muttered anna p vlovna in a terrified whisper 

 what monsieur pierre do you consider that assassination shows
greatness of soul said the little princess smiling and drawing her
work nearer to her 

 oh oh exclaimed several voices 

 capital said prince hippolyte in english and began slapping his
knee with the palm of his hand 

the vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders pierre looked solemnly at his
audience over his spectacles and continued 

 i say so he continued desperately because the bourbons fled
from the revolution leaving the people to anarchy and napoleon alone
understood the revolution and quelled it and so for the general good 
he could not stop short for the sake of one man s life 

 won t you come over to the other table suggested anna
p vlovna 

but pierre continued his speech without heeding her 

 no cried he becoming more and more eager napoleon is great
because he rose superior to the revolution suppressed its abuses 
preserved all that was good in it equality of citizenship and freedom
of speech and of the press and only for that reason did he obtain
power 

 yes if having obtained power without availing himself of it to
commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king i should have
called him a great man remarked the vicomte 

 he could not do that the people only gave him power that he might
rid them of the bourbons and because they saw that he was a great
man the revolution was a grand thing continued monsieur pierre 
betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme
youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind 

 what revolution and regicide a grand thing well after that 
but won t you come to this other table repeated anna p vlovna 

 rousseau s contrat social said the vicomte with a tolerant
smile 

 i am not speaking of regicide i am speaking about ideas 

 yes ideas of robbery murder and regicide again interjected an
ironical voice 

 those were extremes no doubt but they are not what is most
important what is important are the rights of man emancipation from
prejudices and equality of citizenship and all these ideas napoleon
has retained in full force 

 liberty and equality said the vicomte contemptuously as if at
last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words
were high sounding words which have long been discredited who does
not love liberty and equality even our saviour preached liberty and
equality have people since the revolution become happier on the
contrary we wanted liberty but buonaparte has destroyed it 

prince andrew kept looking with an amused smile from pierre to the
vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess in the first moment of
pierre s outburst anna p vlovna despite her social experience was
horror struck but when she saw that pierre s sacrilegious words
had not exasperated the vicomte and had convinced herself that it was
impossible to stop him she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in
a vigorous attack on the orator 

 but my dear monsieur pierre said she how do you explain the
fact of a great man executing a duc or even an ordinary man who is
innocent and untried 

 i should like said the vicomte to ask how monsieur explains
the 18th brumaire was not that an imposture it was a swindle and not
at all like the conduct of a great man 

 and the prisoners he killed in africa that was horrible said the
little princess shrugging her shoulders 

 he s a low fellow say what you will remarked prince hippolyte 

pierre not knowing whom to answer looked at them all and smiled his
smile was unlike the half smile of other people when he smiled 
his grave even rather gloomy look was instantaneously replaced by
another a childlike kindly even rather silly look which seemed to
ask forgiveness 

the vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that
this young jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested all were
silent 

 how do you expect him to answer you all at once said prince
andrew besides in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish
between his acts as a private person as a general and as an emperor 
so it seems to me 

 yes yes of course pierre chimed in pleased at the arrival of
this reinforcement 

 one must admit continued prince andrew that napoleon as a man
was great on the bridge of arcola and in the hospital at jaffa where he
gave his hand to the plague stricken but but there are other acts
which it is difficult to justify 

prince andrew who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of
pierre s remarks rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to
go 

suddenly prince hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend 
and asking them all to be seated began 

 i was told a charming moscow story today and must treat you to it 
excuse me vicomte i must tell it in russian or the point will be
lost and prince hippolyte began to tell his story in such russian
as a frenchman would speak after spending about a year in russia 
everyone waited so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their
attention to his story 

 there is in moscow a lady une dame and she is very stingy she must
have two footmen behind her carriage and very big ones that was her
taste and she had a lady s maid also big she said 

here prince hippolyte paused evidently collecting his ideas with
difficulty 

 she said oh yes she said girl to the maid put on a
livery get up behind the carriage and come with me while i make some
calls 

here prince hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his
audience which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator several
persons among them the elderly lady and anna p vlovna did however
smile 

 she went suddenly there was a great wind the girl lost her hat and
her long hair came down here he could contain himself no
longer and went on between gasps of laughter and the whole world
knew 

and so the anecdote ended though it was unintelligible why he had told
it or why it had to be told in russian still anna p vlovna and the
others appreciated prince hippolyte s social tact in so agreeably
ending pierre s unpleasant and unamiable outburst after the anecdote
the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last
and next balls about theatricals and who would meet whom and when and
where 





chapter vi

having thanked anna p vlovna for her charming soiree the guests began
to take their leave 

pierre was ungainly stout about the average height broad with huge
red hands he did not know as the saying is how to enter a drawing
room and still less how to leave one that is how to say something
particularly agreeable before going away besides this he was
absent minded when he rose to go he took up instead of his own the
general s three cornered hat and held it pulling at the plume 
till the general asked him to restore it all his absent mindedness and
inability to enter a room and converse in it was however redeemed by
his kindly simple and modest expression anna p vlovna turned toward
him and with a christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his
indiscretion nodded and said i hope to see you again but i also
hope you will change your opinions my dear monsieur pierre 

when she said this he did not reply and only bowed but again everybody
saw his smile which said nothing unless perhaps opinions are
opinions but you see what a capital good natured fellow i am and
everyone including anna p vlovna felt this 

prince andrew had gone out into the hall and turning his shoulders
to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak listened
indifferently to his wife s chatter with prince hippolyte who had also
come into the hall prince hippolyte stood close to the pretty pregnant
princess and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass 

 go in annette or you will catch cold said the little princess 
taking leave of anna p vlovna it is settled she added in a low
voice 

anna p vlovna had already managed to speak to lise about the match she
contemplated between anatole and the little princess sister in law 

 i rely on you my dear said anna p vlovna also in a low tone 
 write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter au
revoir and she left the hall 

prince hippolyte approached the little princess and bending his face
close to her began to whisper something 

two footmen the princess and his own stood holding a shawl and
a cloak waiting for the conversation to finish they listened to
the french sentences which to them were meaningless with an air of
understanding but not wishing to appear to do so the princess as usual
spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh 

 i am very glad i did not go to the ambassador s said prince
hippolyte so dull it has been a delightful evening has it
not delightful 

 they say the ball will be very good replied the princess drawing
up her downy little lip all the pretty women in society will be
there 

 not all for you will not be there not all said prince hippolyte
smiling joyfully and snatching the shawl from the footman whom he
even pushed aside he began wrapping it round the princess either from
awkwardness or intentionally no one could have said which after the
shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time as
though embracing her 

still smiling she gracefully moved away turning and glancing at her
husband prince andrew s eyes were closed so weary and sleepy did he
seem 

 are you ready he asked his wife looking past her 

prince hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak which in the latest fashion
reached to his very heels and stumbling in it ran out into the porch
following the princess whom a footman was helping into the carriage 

 princesse au revoir cried he stumbling with his tongue as well
as with his feet 

the princess picking up her dress was taking her seat in the dark
carriage her husband was adjusting his saber prince hippolyte under
pretense of helping was in everyone s way 

 allow me sir said prince andrew in russian in a cold 
disagreeable tone to prince hippolyte who was blocking his path 

 i am expecting you pierre said the same voice but gently and
affectionately 

the postilion started the carriage wheels rattled prince hippolyte
laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte
whom he had promised to take home 

 well mon cher said the vicomte having seated himself beside
hippolyte in the carriage your little princess is very nice very
nice indeed quite french and he kissed the tips of his fingers 
hippolyte burst out laughing 

 do you know you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs 
continued the vicomte i pity the poor husband that little officer
who gives himself the airs of a monarch 

hippolyte spluttered again and amid his laughter said and you were
saying that the russian ladies are not equal to the french one has to
know how to deal with them 

pierre reaching the house first went into prince andrew s study like
one quite at home and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa took
from the shelf the first book that came to his hand it was caesar s
commentaries and resting on his elbow began reading it in the middle 

 what have you done to mlle sch rer she will be quite ill now 
said prince andrew as he entered the study rubbing his small white
hands 

pierre turned his whole body making the sofa creak he lifted his eager
face to prince andrew smiled and waved his hand 

 that abb is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the
right light in my opinion perpetual peace is possible but i do not
know how to express it not by a balance of political power 

it was evident that prince andrew was not interested in such abstract
conversation 

 one can t everywhere say all one thinks mon cher well have
you at last decided on anything are you going to be a guardsman or a
diplomatist asked prince andrew after a momentary silence 

pierre sat up on the sofa with his legs tucked under him 

 really i don t yet know i don t like either the one or the
other 

 but you must decide on something your father expects it 

pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abb as tutor 
and had remained away till he was twenty when he returned to moscow
his father dismissed the abb and said to the young man now go
to petersburg look round and choose your profession i will agree to
anything here is a letter to prince vas li and here is money write
to me all about it and i will help you in everything pierre had
already been choosing a career for three months and had not decided
on anything it was about this choice that prince andrew was speaking 
pierre rubbed his forehead 

 but he must be a freemason said he referring to the abb whom
he had met that evening 

 that is all nonsense prince andrew again interrupted him let
us talk business have you been to the horse guards 

 no i have not but this is what i have been thinking and wanted
to tell you there is a war now against napoleon if it were a war for
freedom i could understand it and should be the first to enter the army 
but to help england and austria against the greatest man in the world is
not right 

prince andrew only shrugged his shoulders at pierre s childish words 
he put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such
nonsense but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other
answer than the one prince andrew gave to this na ve question 

 if no one fought except on his own conviction there would be no
wars he said 

 and that would be splendid said pierre 

prince andrew smiled ironically 

 very likely it would be splendid but it will never come about 

 well why are you going to the war asked pierre 

 what for i don t know i must besides that i am going he
paused i am going because the life i am leading here does not suit
me 





chapter vii

the rustle of a woman s dress was heard in the next room prince
andrew shook himself as if waking up and his face assumed the look it
had had in anna p vlovna s drawing room pierre removed his feet from
the sofa the princess came in she had changed her gown for a house
dress as fresh and elegant as the other prince andrew rose and politely
placed a chair for her 

 how is it she began as usual in french settling down briskly
and fussily in the easy chair how is it annette never got married 
how stupid you men all are not to have married her excuse me for saying
so but you have no sense about women what an argumentative fellow you
are monsieur pierre 

 and i am still arguing with your husband i can t understand why he
wants to go to the war replied pierre addressing the princess
with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their
intercourse with young women 

the princess started evidently pierre s words touched her to the
quick 

 ah that is just what i tell him said she i don t
understand it i don t in the least understand why men can t live
without wars how is it that we women don t want anything of the kind 
don t need it now you shall judge between us i always tell him here
he is uncle s aide de camp a most brilliant position he is so
well known so much appreciated by everyone the other day at the
apr ksins i heard a lady asking is that the famous prince
andrew i did indeed she laughed he is so well received
everywhere he might easily become aide de camp to the emperor you know
the emperor spoke to him most graciously annette and i were speaking of
how to arrange it what do you think 

pierre looked at his friend and noticing that he did not like the
conversation gave no reply 

 when are you starting he asked 

 oh don t speak of his going don t i won t hear it spoken
of said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which
she had spoken to hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly
ill suited to the family circle of which pierre was almost a member 
 today when i remembered that all these delightful associations
must be broken off and then you know andr she looked
significantly at her husband i m afraid i m afraid she
whispered and a shudder ran down her back 

her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides
pierre and himself was in the room and addressed her in a tone of
frigid politeness 

 what is it you are afraid of lise i don t understand said he 

 there what egotists men all are all all egotists just for a whim
of his own goodness only knows why he leaves me and locks me up alone
in the country 

 with my father and sister remember said prince andrew gently 

 alone all the same without my friends and he expects me not to
be afraid 

her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up giving her not a
joyful but an animal squirrel like expression she paused as if she
felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before pierre though the
gist of the matter lay in that 

 i still can t understand what you are afraid of said prince
andrew slowly not taking his eyes off his wife 

the princess blushed and raised her arms with a gesture of despair 

 no andrew i must say you have changed oh how you have 

 your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier said prince andrew 
 you had better go 

the princess said nothing but suddenly her short downy lip quivered 
prince andrew rose shrugged his shoulders and walked about the room 

pierre looked over his spectacles with na ve surprise now at him and
now at her moved as if about to rise too but changed his mind 

 why should i mind monsieur pierre being here exclaimed the little
princess suddenly her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful
grimace i have long wanted to ask you andrew why you have changed
so to me what have i done to you you are going to the war and have no
pity for me why is it 

 lise was all prince andrew said but that one word expressed
an entreaty a threat and above all conviction that she would herself
regret her words but she went on hurriedly 

 you treat me like an invalid or a child i see it all did you behave
like that six months ago 

 lise i beg you to desist said prince andrew still more
emphatically 

pierre who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to
all this rose and approached the princess he seemed unable to bear the
sight of tears and was ready to cry himself 

 calm yourself princess it seems so to you because i assure you
i myself have experienced and so because no excuse me 
an outsider is out of place here no don t distress yourself 
good by 

prince andrew caught him by the hand 

 no wait pierre the princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of
the pleasure of spending the evening with you 

 no he thinks only of himself muttered the princess without
restraining her angry tears 

 lise said prince andrew dryly raising his voice to the pitch
which indicates that patience is exhausted 

suddenly the angry squirrel like expression of the princess pretty
face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear her beautiful eyes
glanced askance at her husband s face and her own assumed the timid 
deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its
drooping tail 

 mon dieu mon dieu she muttered and lifting her dress with one
hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead 

 good night lise said he rising and courteously kissing her hand
as he would have done to a stranger 





chapter viii

the friends were silent neither cared to begin talking pierre
continually glanced at prince andrew prince andrew rubbed his forehead
with his small hand 

 let us go and have supper he said with a sigh going to the door 

they entered the elegant newly decorated and luxurious dining room 
everything from the table napkins to the silver china and glass bore
that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married 
halfway through supper prince andrew leaned his elbows on the table and 
with a look of nervous agitation such as pierre had never before seen on
his face began to talk as one who has long had something on his mind
and suddenly determines to speak out 

 never never marry my dear fellow that s my advice never marry
till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of 
and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen
her plainly as she is or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable
mistake marry when you are old and good for nothing or all that is
good and noble in you will be lost it will all be wasted on trifles 
yes yes yes don t look at me with such surprise if you marry
expecting anything from yourself in the future you will feel at every
step that for you all is ended all is closed except the drawing
room where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an
idiot but what s the good and he waved his arm 

pierre took off his spectacles which made his face seem different and
the good natured expression still more apparent and gazed at his friend
in amazement 

 my wife continued prince andrew is an excellent woman one
of those rare women with whom a man s honor is safe but o god what
would i not give now to be unmarried you are the first and only one to
whom i mention this because i like you 

as he said this prince andrew was less than ever like that bolk nski
who had lolled in anna p vlovna s easy chairs and with half closed
eyes had uttered french phrases between his teeth every muscle of his
thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement his eyes in which
the fire of life had seemed extinguished now flashed with brilliant
light it was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary
times the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid
irritation 

 you don t understand why i say this he continued but it is
the whole story of life you talk of bonaparte and his career said
he though pierre had not mentioned bonaparte but bonaparte when
he worked went step by step toward his goal he was free he had nothing
but his aim to consider and he reached it but tie yourself up with
a woman and like a chained convict you lose all freedom and all you
have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with
regret drawing rooms gossip balls vanity and triviality these are
the enchanted circle i cannot escape from i am now going to the war 
the greatest war there ever was and i know nothing and am fit for
nothing i am very amiable and have a caustic wit continued prince
andrew and at anna p vlovna s they listen to me and that stupid
set without whom my wife cannot exist and those women if you only
knew what those society women are and women in general my father is
right selfish vain stupid trivial in everything that s what
women are when you see them in their true colors when you meet them
in society it seems as if there were something in them but there s
nothing nothing nothing no don t marry my dear fellow don t
marry concluded prince andrew 

 it seems funny to me said pierre that you you should
consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life you have
everything before you everything and you 

he did not finish his sentence but his tone showed how highly he
thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future 

 how can he talk like that thought pierre he considered his
friend a model of perfection because prince andrew possessed in the
highest degree just the very qualities pierre lacked and which might
be best described as strength of will pierre was always astonished at
prince andrew s calm manner of treating everybody his extraordinary
memory his extensive reading he had read everything knew everything 
and had an opinion about everything but above all at his capacity for
work and study and if pierre was often struck by andrew s lack
of capacity for philosophical meditation to which he himself was
particularly addicted he regarded even this not as a defect but as a
sign of strength 

even in the best most friendly and simplest relations of life praise
and commendation are essential just as grease is necessary to wheels
that they may run smoothly 

 my part is played out said prince andrew what s the use of
talking about me let us talk about you he added after a silence 
smiling at his reassuring thoughts 

that smile was immediately reflected on pierre s face 

 but what is there to say about me said pierre his face relaxing
into a careless merry smile what am i an illegitimate son 
he suddenly blushed crimson and it was plain that he had made a great
effort to say this without a name and without means and it
really but he did not say what it really was for the
present i am free and am all right only i haven t the least idea what
i am to do i wanted to consult you seriously 

prince andrew looked kindly at him yet his glance friendly and
affectionate as it was expressed a sense of his own superiority 

 i am fond of you especially as you are the one live man among our
whole set yes you re all right choose what you will it s all the
same you ll be all right anywhere but look here give up visiting
those kur gins and leading that sort of life it suits you so
badly all this debauchery dissipation and the rest of it 

 what would you have my dear fellow answered pierre shrugging
his shoulders women my dear fellow women 

 i don t understand it replied prince andrew women who are
comme il faut that s a different matter but the kur gins set of
women women and wine i don t understand 

pierre was staying at prince vas li kur gin s and sharing the
dissipated life of his son anatole the son whom they were planning to
reform by marrying him to prince andrew s sister 

 do you know said pierre as if suddenly struck by a happy
thought seriously i have long been thinking of it leading such
a life i can t decide or think properly about anything one s head
aches and one spends all one s money he asked me for tonight but i
won t go 

 you give me your word of honor not to go 

 on my honor 





chapter ix

it was past one o clock when pierre left his friend it was a
cloudless northern summer night pierre took an open cab intending
to drive straight home but the nearer he drew to the house the more he
felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night it was light
enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like
morning or evening than night on the way pierre remembered that anatole
kur gin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening after which
there was generally a drinking bout finishing with visits of a kind
pierre was very fond of 

 i should like to go to kur gin s thought he 

but he immediately recalled his promise to prince andrew not to go
there then as happens to people of weak character he desired so
passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to
that he decided to go the thought immediately occurred to him that his
promise to prince andrew was of no account because before he gave it
he had already promised prince anatole to come to his gathering 
 besides thought he all such words of honor are
conventional things with no definite meaning especially if
one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead or something so
extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the
same pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort nullifying
all his decisions and intentions he went to kur gin s 

reaching the large house near the horse guards barracks in which
anatole lived pierre entered the lighted porch ascended the stairs 
and went in at the open door there was no one in the anteroom empty
bottles cloaks and overshoes were lying about there was a smell of
alcohol and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance 

cards and supper were over but the visitors had not yet dispersed 
pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room in which were the
remains of supper a footman thinking no one saw him was drinking on
the sly what was left in the glasses from the third room came sounds of
laughter the shouting of familiar voices the growling of a bear and
general commotion some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously
round an open window three others were romping with a young bear one
pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others 

 i bet a hundred on stevens shouted one 

 mind no holding on cried another 

 i bet on d lokhov cried a third kur gin you part our
hands 

 there leave bruin alone here s a bet on 

 at one draught or he loses shouted a fourth 

 jacob bring a bottle shouted the host a tall handsome fellow
who stood in the midst of the group without a coat and with his fine
linen shirt unfastened in front wait a bit you fellows here is
p tya good man cried he addressing pierre 

another voice from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes 
particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober
ring cried from the window come here part the bets this was
d lokhov an officer of the sem nov regiment a notorious gambler and
duelist who was living with anatole pierre smiled looking about him
merrily 

 i don t understand what s it all about 

 wait a bit he is not drunk yet a bottle here said anatole and
taking a glass from the table he went up to pierre 

 first of all you must drink 

pierre drank one glass after another looking from under his brows at
the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window and listening
to their chatter anatole kept on refilling pierre s glass while
explaining that d lokhov was betting with stevens an english naval
officer that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge
of the third floor window with his legs hanging out 

 go on you must drink it all said anatole giving pierre the last
glass or i won t let you go 

 no i won t said pierre pushing anatole aside and he went up
to the window 

d lokhov was holding the englishman s hand and clearly and distinctly
repeating the terms of the bet addressing himself particularly to
anatole and pierre 

d lokhov was of medium height with curly hair and light blue eyes he
was about twenty five like all infantry officers he wore no mustache 
so that his mouth the most striking feature of his face was clearly
seen the lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved the middle
of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm
lower one and something like two distinct smiles played continually
round the two corners of the mouth this together with the resolute 
insolent intelligence of his eyes produced an effect which made it
impossible not to notice his face d lokhov was a man of small means
and no connections yet though anatole spent tens of thousands of
rubles d lokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a
footing that all who knew them including anatole himself respected him
more than they did anatole d lokhov could play all games and nearly
always won however much he drank he never lost his clearheadedness 
both kur gin and d lokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes
and scapegraces of petersburg 

the bottle of rum was brought the window frame which prevented anyone
from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen who
were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of
the gentlemen around 

anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window he wanted to
smash something pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame but
could not move it he smashed a pane 

 you have a try hercules said he turning to pierre 

pierre seized the crossbeam tugged and wrenched the oak frame out with
a crash 

 take it right out or they ll think i m holding on said
d lokhov 

 is the englishman bragging eh is it all right said anatole 

 first rate said pierre looking at d lokhov who with a bottle
of rum in his hand was approaching the window from which the light of
the sky the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset was visible 

d lokhov the bottle of rum still in his hand jumped onto the window
sill listen cried he standing there and addressing those in the
room all were silent 

 i bet fifty imperials he spoke french that the englishman might
understand him but he did not speak it very well i bet fifty
imperials or do you wish to make it a hundred added he 
addressing the englishman 

 no fifty replied the latter 

 all right fifty imperials that i will drink a whole bottle of
rum without taking it from my mouth sitting outside the window on this
spot he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window 
 and without holding on to anything is that right 

 quite right said the englishman 

anatole turned to the englishman and taking him by one of the buttons
of his coat and looking down at him the englishman was short began
repeating the terms of the wager to him in english 

 wait cried d lokhov hammering with the bottle on the window
sill to attract attention wait a bit kur gin listen if
anyone else does the same i will pay him a hundred imperials do you
understand 

the englishman nodded but gave no indication whether he intended to
accept this challenge or not anatole did not release him and though
he kept nodding to show that he understood anatole went on translating
d lokhov s words into english a thin young lad an hussar of the
life guards who had been losing that evening climbed on the window
sill leaned over and looked down 

 oh oh oh he muttered looking down from the window at the
stones of the pavement 

 shut up cried d lokhov pushing him away from the window the
lad jumped awkwardly back into the room tripping over his spurs 

placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily 
d lokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered
his legs pressing against both sides of the window he adjusted himself
on his seat lowered his hands moved a little to the right and then to
the left and took up the bottle anatole brought two candles and
placed them on the window sill though it was already quite light 
d lokhov s back in his white shirt and his curly head were lit
up from both sides everyone crowded to the window the englishman in
front pierre stood smiling but silent one man older than the others
present suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted
to seize hold of d lokhov s shirt 

 i say this is folly he ll be killed said this more sensible
man 

anatole stopped him 

 don t touch him you ll startle him and then he ll be killed 
eh what then eh 

d lokhov turned round and again holding on with both hands arranged
himself on his seat 

 if anyone comes meddling again said he emitting the words
separately through his thin compressed lips i will throw him down
there now then 

saying this he again turned round dropped his hands took the bottle
and lifted it to his lips threw back his head and raised his free hand
to balance himself one of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some
broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the
window and from d lokhov s back anatole stood erect with staring
eyes the englishman looked on sideways pursing up his lips the man
who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw
himself on a sofa with his face to the wall pierre hid his face from
which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed
horror and fear all were still pierre took his hands from his eyes 
d lokhov still sat in the same position only his head was thrown
further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar and the hand
holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the
effort the bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher
and his head tilting yet further back why is it so long thought
pierre it seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed 
suddenly d lokhov made a backward movement with his spine and his arm
trembled nervously this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip
as he sat on the sloping ledge as he began slipping down his head and
arm wavered still more with the strain one hand moved as if to clutch
the window sill but refrained from touching it pierre again covered
his eyes and thought he would never open them again suddenly he was
aware of a stir all around he looked up d lokhov was standing on the
window sill with a pale but radiant face 

 it s empty 

he threw the bottle to the englishman who caught it neatly d lokhov
jumped down he smelt strongly of rum 

 well done fine fellow there s a bet for you devil take
you came from different sides 

the englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money 
d lokhov stood frowning and did not speak pierre jumped upon the
window sill 

 gentlemen who wishes to bet with me i ll do the same thing 
he suddenly cried even without a bet there tell them to bring me a
bottle i ll do it bring a bottle 

 let him do it let him do it said d lokhov smiling 

 what next have you gone mad no one would let you why you go
giddy even on a staircase exclaimed several voices 

 i ll drink it let s have a bottle of rum shouted pierre 
banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to
climb out of the window 

they seized him by his arms but he was so strong that everyone who
touched him was sent flying 

 no you ll never manage him that way said anatole wait a
bit and i ll get round him listen i ll take your bet tomorrow 
but now we are all going to s 

 come on then cried pierre come on and we ll take bruin
with us 

and he caught the bear took it in his arms lifted it from the ground 
and began dancing round the room with it 





chapter x

prince vas li kept the promise he had given to princess drubetsk ya
who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son bor s on the evening of
anna p vlovna s soiree the matter was mentioned to the emperor an
exception made and bor s transferred into the regiment of sem nov
guards with the rank of cornet he received however no appointment
to kut zov s staff despite all anna mikh ylovna s endeavors and
entreaties soon after anna p vlovna s reception anna mikh ylovna
returned to moscow and went straight to her rich relations the
rost vs with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling
b ry who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being
at once transferred to the guards as a cornet had been educated from
childhood and lived for years at a time the guards had already left
petersburg on the tenth of august and her son who had remained in
moscow for his equipment was to join them on the march to radziv lov 

it was st natalia s day and the name day of two of the rost vs the
mother and the youngest daughter both named nataly ever since
the morning carriages with six horses had been coming and going
continually bringing visitors to the countess rost va s big house on
the povarsk ya so well known to all moscow the countess herself and
her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors
who came to congratulate and who constantly succeeded one another in
relays 

the countess was a woman of about forty five with a thin oriental type
of face evidently worn out with childbearing she had had twelve 
a languor of motion and speech resulting from weakness gave her a
distinguished air which inspired respect princess anna mikh ylovna
drubetsk ya who as a member of the household was also seated in the
drawing room helped to receive and entertain the visitors the young
people were in one of the inner rooms not considering it necessary to
take part in receiving the visitors the count met the guests and saw
them off inviting them all to dinner 

 i am very very grateful to you mon cher or ma ch re he
called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation
in his tone my dear whether they were above or below him in
rank i thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name
day we are keeping but mind you come to dinner or i shall be offended 
ma ch re on behalf of the whole family i beg you to come mon cher 
these words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation and
with the same expression on his full cheerful clean shaven face the
same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick repeated bows as
soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were
still in the drawing room drew a chair toward him or her and jauntily
spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air
of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live he swayed to and
fro with dignity offered surmises about the weather or touched on
questions of health sometimes in russian and sometimes in very bad but
self confident french then again like a man weary but unflinching in
the fulfillment of duty he rose to see some visitors off and stroking
his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch also asked them to dinner 
sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the
conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall where tables
were being set out for eighty people and looking at the footmen who
were bringing in silver and china moving tables and unfolding damask
table linen he would call dm tri vas levich a man of good family and
the manager of all his affairs and while looking with pleasure at the
enormous table would say well dm tri you ll see that things are
all as they should be that s right the great thing is the serving 
that s it and with a complacent sigh he would return to the
drawing room 

 m rya lv vna kar gina and her daughter announced the
countess gigantic footman in his bass voice entering the drawing
room the countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold
snuffbox with her husband s portrait on it 

 i m quite worn out by these callers however i ll see her and
no more she is so affected ask her in she said to the footman in a
sad voice as if saying very well finish me off 

a tall stout and proud looking woman with a round faced smiling
daughter entered the drawing room their dresses rustling 

 dear countess what an age she has been laid up poor child 
at the razum vski s ball and countess apr ksina i was
so delighted came the sounds of animated feminine voices 
interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and
the scraping of chairs then one of those conversations began which last
out until at the first pause the guests rise with a rustle of dresses
and say i am so delighted mamma s health and countess
apr ksina and then again rustling pass into the anteroom put
on cloaks or mantles and drive away the conversation was on the chief
topic of the day the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of
catherine s day count bez khov and about his illegitimate son
pierre the one who had behaved so improperly at anna p vlovna s
reception 

 i am so sorry for the poor count said the visitor he is in
such bad health and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill
him 

 what is that asked the countess as if she did not know what the
visitor alluded to though she had already heard about the cause of
count bez khov s distress some fifteen times 

 that s what comes of a modern education exclaimed the visitor 
 it seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do
as he liked now in petersburg i hear he has been doing such terrible
things that he has been expelled by the police 

 you don t say so replied the countess 

 he chose his friends badly interposed anna mikh ylovna 
 prince vas li s son he and a certain d lokhov have it is said 
been up to heaven only knows what and they have had to suffer for it 
d lokhov has been degraded to the ranks and bez khov s son sent
back to moscow anatole kur gin s father managed somehow to get his
son s affair hushed up but even he was ordered out of petersburg 

 but what have they been up to asked the countess 

 they are regular brigands especially d lokhov replied the
visitor he is a son of m rya iv novna d lokhova such a worthy
woman but there just fancy those three got hold of a bear somewhere 
put it in a carriage and set off with it to visit some actresses the
police tried to interfere and what did the young men do they tied
a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the moyka
canal and there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his
back 

 what a nice figure the policeman must have cut my dear shouted
the count dying with laughter 

 oh how dreadful how can you laugh at it count 

yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing 

 it was all they could do to rescue the poor man continued the
visitor and to think it is cyril vlad mirovich bez khov s son
who amuses himself in this sensible manner and he was said to be so
well educated and clever this is all that his foreign education has
done for him i hope that here in moscow no one will receive him in
spite of his money they wanted to introduce him to me but i quite
declined i have my daughters to consider 

 why do you say this young man is so rich asked the countess 
turning away from the girls who at once assumed an air of inattention 
 his children are all illegitimate i think pierre also is
illegitimate 

the visitor made a gesture with her hand 

 i should think he has a score of them 

princess anna mikh ylovna intervened in the conversation evidently
wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in
society 

 the fact of the matter is said she significantly and also in a
half whisper everyone knows count cyril s reputation he has
lost count of his children but this pierre was his favorite 

 how handsome the old man still was only a year ago remarked the
countess i have never seen a handsomer man 

 he is very much altered now said anna mikh ylovna well as
i was saying prince vas li is the next heir through his wife but the
count is very fond of pierre looked after his education and wrote to
the emperor about him so that in the case of his death and he is
so ill that he may die at any moment and dr lorrain has come from
petersburg no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune pierre
or prince vas li forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles i know
it all very well for prince vas li told me himself besides cyril
vlad mirovich is my mother s second cousin he s also my b ry s
godfather she added as if she attached no importance at all to the
fact 

 prince vas li arrived in moscow yesterday i hear he has come on
some inspection business remarked the visitor 

 yes but between ourselves said the princess that is a
pretext the fact is he has come to see count cyril vlad mirovich 
hearing how ill he is 

 but do you know my dear that was a capital joke said the count 
and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening he turned to the
young ladies i can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman
cut 

and as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman his portly form
again shook with a deep ringing laugh the laugh of one who always eats
well and in particular drinks well so do come and dine with us 
he said 





chapter xi

silence ensued the countess looked at her callers smiling affably 
but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they
now rose and took their leave the visitor s daughter was already
smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother when
suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls
running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over and a girl
of thirteen hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock 
darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room it was evident
that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far behind her in
the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar an officer
of the guards a girl of fifteen and a plump rosy faced boy in a short
jacket 

the count jumped up and swaying from side to side spread his arms wide
and threw them round the little girl who had run in 

 ah here she is he exclaimed laughing my pet whose name day
it is my dear pet 

 ma ch re there is a time for everything said the countess with
feigned severity you spoil her ily she added turning to her
husband 

 how do you do my dear i wish you many happy returns of your name
day said the visitor what a charming child she added 
addressing the mother 

this black eyed wide mouthed girl not pretty but full of life with
childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her
bodice with black curls tossed backward thin bare arms little legs
in lace frilled drawers and feet in low slippers was just at that
charming age when a girl is no longer a child though the child is not
yet a young woman escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed
face in the lace of her mother s mantilla not paying the least
attention to her severe remark and began to laugh she laughed and in
fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced
from the folds of her frock 

 do you see my doll mimi you see was all nat sha
managed to utter to her everything seemed funny she leaned against
her mother and burst into such a loud ringing fit of laughter that even
the prim visitor could not help joining in 

 now then go away and take your monstrosity with you said the
mother pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness and turning
to the visitor she added she is my youngest girl 

nat sha raising her face for a moment from her mother s mantilla 
glanced up at her through tears of laughter and again hid her face 

the visitor compelled to look on at this family scene thought it
necessary to take some part in it 

 tell me my dear said she to nat sha is mimi a relation of
yours a daughter i suppose 

nat sha did not like the visitor s tone of condescension to childish
things she did not reply but looked at her seriously 

meanwhile the younger generation bor s the officer anna
mikh ylovna s son nicholas the undergraduate the count s eldest
son s nya the count s fifteen year old niece and little p tya 
his youngest boy had all settled down in the drawing room and were
obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement
and mirth that shone in all their faces evidently in the back rooms 
from which they had dashed out so impetuously the conversation had
been more amusing than the drawing room talk of society scandals the
weather and countess apr ksina now and then they glanced at one
another hardly able to suppress their laughter 

the two young men the student and the officer friends from childhood 
were of the same age and both handsome fellows though not alike bor s
was tall and fair and his calm and handsome face had regular delicate
features nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression 
dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip and his whole face
expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm nicholas blushed when he entered
the drawing room he evidently tried to find something to say but
failed bor s on the contrary at once found his footing and related
quietly and humorously how he had known that doll mimi when she was
still quite a young lady before her nose was broken how she had aged
during the five years he had known her and how her head had cracked
right across the skull having said this he glanced at nat sha 
she turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother who was
screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter and unable
to control herself any longer she jumped up and rushed from the room as
fast as her nimble little feet would carry her bor s did not laugh 

 you were meaning to go out weren t you mamma do you want the
carriage he asked his mother with a smile 

 yes yes go and tell them to get it ready she answered 
returning his smile 

bor s quietly left the room and went in search of nat sha the plump
boy ran after them angrily as if vexed that their program had been
disturbed 





chapter xii

the only young people remaining in the drawing room not counting the
young lady visitor and the countess eldest daughter who was four
years older than her sister and behaved already like a grown up person 
were nicholas and s nya the niece s nya was a slender little
brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long
lashes thick black plaits coiling twice round her head and a tawny
tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but
graceful and muscular arms and neck by the grace of her movements 
by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs and by a certain
coyness and reserve of manner she reminded one of a pretty half grown
kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat she evidently
considered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by
smiling but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes
watched her cousin who was going to join the army with such passionate
girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose
upon anyone and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to
spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as
they too could like nat sha and bor s escape from the drawing room 

 ah yes my dear said the count addressing the visitor and
pointing to nicholas his friend bor s has become an officer and
so for friendship s sake he is leaving the university and me his
old father and entering the military service my dear and there was a
place and everything waiting for him in the archives department isn t
that friendship remarked the count in an inquiring tone 

 but they say that war has been declared replied the visitor 

 they ve been saying so a long while said the count and
they ll say so again and again and that will be the end of it my
dear there s friendship for you he repeated he s joining
the hussars 

the visitor not knowing what to say shook her head 

 it s not at all from friendship declared nicholas flaring
up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion it is not from
friendship at all i simply feel that the army is my vocation 

he glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor and they were both
regarding him with a smile of approbation 

 schubert the colonel of the p vlograd hussars is dining with us
today he has been here on leave and is taking nicholas back with him 
it can t be helped said the count shrugging his shoulders and
speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him 

 i have already told you papa said his son that if you
don t wish to let me go i ll stay but i know i am no use anywhere
except in the army i am not a diplomat or a government clerk i
don t know how to hide what i feel as he spoke he kept glancing
with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at s nya and the young
lady visitor 

the little kitten feasting her eyes on him seemed ready at any moment
to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature 

 all right all right said the old count he always flares up 
this buonaparte has turned all their heads they all think of how he
rose from an ensign and became emperor well well god grant it he
added not noticing his visitor s sarcastic smile 

the elders began talking about bonaparte julie kar gina turned to
young rost v 

 what a pity you weren t at the arkh rovs on thursday it was so
dull without you said she giving him a tender smile 

the young man flattered sat down nearer to her with a coquettish
smile and engaged the smiling julie in a confidential conversation
without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart
of s nya who blushed and smiled unnaturally in the midst of his talk
he glanced round at her she gave him a passionately angry glance and
hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile
on her lips she got up and left the room all nicholas animation
vanished he waited for the first pause in the conversation and then
with a distressed face left the room to find s nya 

 how plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their
sleeves said anna mikh ylovna pointing to nicholas as he went out 
 cousinage dangereux voisinage she added 

 cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood 

 yes said the countess when the brightness these young people had
brought into the room had vanished and as if answering a question no
one had put but which was always in her mind and how much suffering 
how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in
them now and yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy one is
always always anxious especially just at this age so dangerous both
for girls and boys 

 it all depends on the bringing up remarked the visitor 

 yes you re quite right continued the countess till now i
have always thank god been my children s friend and had their full
confidence said she repeating the mistake of so many parents who
imagine that their children have no secrets from them i know i shall
always be my daughters first confidante and that if nicholas with
his impulsive nature does get into mischief a boy can t help it he
will all the same never be like those petersburg young men 

 yes they are splendid splendid youngsters chimed in the count 
who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding
that everything was splendid just fancy wants to be an hussar 
what s one to do my dear 

 what a charming creature your younger girl is said the visitor 
 a little volcano 

 yes a regular volcano said the count takes after me and
what a voice she has though she s my daughter i tell the truth
when i say she ll be a singer a second salomoni we have engaged an
italian to give her lessons 

 isn t she too young i have heard that it harms the voice to train
it at that age 

 oh no not at all too young replied the count why our
mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen 

 and she s in love with bor s already just fancy said the
countess with a gentle smile looking at bor s and went on evidently
concerned with a thought that always occupied her now you see if i
were to be severe with her and to forbid it goodness knows what they
might be up to on the sly she meant that they would be kissing 
 but as it is i know every word she utters she will come running to
me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything perhaps i
spoil her but really that seems the best plan with her elder sister i
was stricter 

 yes i was brought up quite differently remarked the handsome
elder daughter countess v ra with a smile 

but the smile did not enhance v ra s beauty as smiles generally do 
on the contrary it gave her an unnatural and therefore unpleasant 
expression v ra was good looking not at all stupid quick at
learning was well brought up and had a pleasant voice what she said
was true and appropriate yet strange to say everyone the visitors
and countess alike turned to look at her as if wondering why she had
said it and they all felt awkward 

 people are always too clever with their eldest children and try to
make something exceptional of them said the visitor 

 what s the good of denying it my dear our dear countess was too
clever with v ra said the count well what of that she s
turned out splendidly all the same he added winking at v ra 

the guests got up and took their leave promising to return to dinner 

 what manners i thought they would never go said the countess 
when she had seen her guests out 





chapter xiii

when nat sha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the
conservatory there she paused and stood listening to the conversation
in the drawing room waiting for bor s to come out she was already
growing impatient and stamped her foot ready to cry at his not coming
at once when she heard the young man s discreet steps approaching
neither quickly nor slowly at this nat sha dashed swiftly among the
flower tubs and hid there 

bor s paused in the middle of the room looked round brushed a little
dust from the sleeve of his uniform and going up to a mirror examined
his handsome face nat sha very still peered out from her ambush 
waiting to see what he would do he stood a little while before the
glass smiled and walked toward the other door nat sha was about to
call him but changed her mind let him look for me thought she 
hardly had bor s gone than s nya flushed in tears and muttering
angrily came in at the other door nat sha checked her first impulse
to run out to her and remained in her hiding place watching as
under an invisible cap to see what went on in the world she was
experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure s nya muttering to herself 
kept looking round toward the drawing room door it opened and nicholas
came in 

 s nya what is the matter with you how can you said he running
up to her 

 it s nothing nothing leave me alone sobbed s nya 

 ah i know what it is 

 well if you do so much the better and you can go back to her 

 s o onya look here how can you torture me and yourself like that 
for a mere fancy said nicholas taking her hand 

s nya did not pull it away and left off crying nat sha not stirring
and scarcely breathing watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes 
 what will happen now thought she 

 s nya what is anyone in the world to me you alone are
everything said nicholas and i will prove it to you 

 i don t like you to talk like that 

 well then i won t only forgive me s nya he drew her to him
and kissed her 

 oh how nice thought nat sha and when s nya and nicholas had
gone out of the conservatory she followed and called bor s to her 

 bor s come here said she with a sly and significant look i
have something to tell you here here and she led him into the
conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding 

bor s followed her smiling 

 what is the something asked he 

she grew confused glanced round and seeing the doll she had thrown
down on one of the tubs picked it up 

 kiss the doll said she 

bor s looked attentively and kindly at her eager face but did not
reply 

 don t you want to well then come here said she and
went further in among the plants and threw down the doll closer 
closer she whispered 

she caught the young officer by his cuffs and a look of solemnity and
fear appeared on her flushed face 

 and me would you like to kiss me she whispered almost inaudibly 
glancing up at him from under her brows smiling and almost crying from
excitement 

bor s blushed 

 how funny you are he said bending down to her and blushing still
more but he waited and did nothing 

suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he embraced him so
that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck and tossing
back her hair kissed him full on the lips 

then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs
and stood hanging her head 

 nat sha he said you know that i love you but 

 you are in love with me nat sha broke in 

 yes i am but please don t let us do like that in another four
years then i will ask for your hand 

nat sha considered 

 thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen she counted on her slender
little fingers all right then it s settled 

a smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face 

 settled replied bor s 

 forever said the little girl till death itself 

she took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining
sitting room 





chapter xiv

after receiving her visitors the countess was so tired that she gave
orders to admit no more but the porter was told to be sure to invite to
dinner all who came to congratulate the countess wished to have
a t te t te talk with the friend of her childhood princess anna
mikh ylovna whom she had not seen properly since she returned from
petersburg anna mikh ylovna with her tear worn but pleasant face 
drew her chair nearer to that of the countess 

 with you i will be quite frank said anna mikh ylovna there
are not many left of us old friends that s why i so value your
friendship 

anna mikh ylovna looked at v ra and paused the countess pressed her
friend s hand 

 v ra she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a
favorite how is it you have so little tact don t you see you are
not wanted here go to the other girls or 

the handsome v ra smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt 

 if you had told me sooner mamma i would have gone she replied
as she rose to go to her own room 

but as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting 
one pair at each window she stopped and smiled scornfully s nya was
sitting close to nicholas who was copying out some verses for her the
first he had ever written bor s and nat sha were at the other window
and ceased talking when v ra entered s nya and nat sha looked at
v ra with guilty happy faces 

it was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love but
apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in v ra 

 how often have i asked you not to take my things she said you
have a room of your own and she took the inkstand from nicholas 

 in a minute in a minute he said dipping his pen 

 you always manage to do things at the wrong time continued v ra 
 you came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed
of you 

though what she said was quite just perhaps for that very reason no one
replied and the four simply looked at one another she lingered in the
room with the inkstand in her hand 

 and at your age what secrets can there be between nat sha and
bor s or between you two it s all nonsense 

 now v ra what does it matter to you said nat sha in defense 
speaking very gently 

she seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to
everyone 

 very silly said v ra i am ashamed of you secrets indeed 

 all have secrets of their own answered nat sha getting warmer 
 we don t interfere with you and berg 

 i should think not said v ra because there can never be
anything wrong in my behavior but i ll just tell mamma how you are
behaving with bor s 

 nat lya ilyn chna behaves very well to me remarked bor s i
have nothing to complain of 

 don t bor s you are such a diplomat that it is really
tiresome said nat sha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly 
 she used the word diplomat which was just then much in vogue
among the children in the special sense they attached to it why
does she bother me and she added turning to v ra you ll
never understand it because you ve never loved anyone you have no
heart you are a madame de genlis and nothing more this nickname 
bestowed on v ra by nicholas was considered very stinging and
your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people go and flirt with
berg as much as you please she finished quickly 

 i shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors 

 well now you ve done what you wanted put in nicholas said
unpleasant things to everyone and upset them let s go to the
nursery 

all four like a flock of scared birds got up and left the room 

 the unpleasant things were said to me remarked v ra i said
none to anyone 

 madame de genlis madame de genlis shouted laughing voices
through the door 

the handsome v ra who produced such an irritating and unpleasant
effect on everyone smiled and evidently unmoved by what had been
said to her went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf 
looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and
calmer 


in the drawing room the conversation was still going on 

 ah my dear said the countess my life is not all roses
either don t i know that at the rate we are living our means won t
last long it s all the club and his easygoing nature even in the
country do we get any rest theatricals hunting and heaven knows what
besides but don t let s talk about me tell me how you managed
everything i often wonder at you annette how at your age you
can rush off alone in a carriage to moscow to petersburg to those
ministers and great people and know how to deal with them all it s
quite astonishing how did you get things settled i couldn t possibly
do it 

 ah my love answered anna mikh ylovna god grant you never
know what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love
to distraction one learns many things then she added with a certain
pride that lawsuit taught me much when i want to see one of those
big people i write a note princess so and so desires an interview
with so and so and then i take a cab and go myself two three or
four times till i get what i want i don t mind what they think of
me 

 well and to whom did you apply about b ry asked the countess 
 you see yours is already an officer in the guards while my nicholas
is going as a cadet there s no one to interest himself for him to
whom did you apply 

 to prince vas li he was so kind he at once agreed to everything 
and put the matter before the emperor said princess anna
mikh ylovna enthusiastically quite forgetting all the humiliation she
had endured to gain her end 

 has prince vas li aged much asked the countess i have not
seen him since we acted together at the rumy ntsovs theatricals i
expect he has forgotten me he paid me attentions in those days said
the countess with a smile 

 he is just the same as ever replied anna mikh ylovna 
 overflowing with amiability his position has not turned his head
at all he said to me i am sorry i can do so little for you dear
princess i am at your command yes he is a fine fellow and a very
kind relation but nataly you know my love for my son i would do
anything for his happiness and my affairs are in such a bad way that my
position is now a terrible one continued anna mikh ylovna sadly 
dropping her voice my wretched lawsuit takes all i have and makes no
progress would you believe it i have literally not a penny and don t
know how to equip bor s she took out her handkerchief and began to
cry i need five hundred rubles and have only one twenty five ruble
note i am in such a state my only hope now is in count cyril
vlad mirovich bez khov if he will not assist his godson you know
he is b ry s godfather and allow him something for his maintenance 
all my trouble will have been thrown away i shall not be able to
equip him 

the countess eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence 

 i often think though perhaps it s a sin said the princess 
 that here lives count cyril vlad mirovich bez khov so rich all
alone that tremendous fortune and what is his life worth it s a
burden to him and b ry s life is only just beginning 

 surely he will leave something to bor s said the countess 

 heaven only knows my dear these rich grandees are so selfish 
still i will take bor s and go to see him at once and i shall speak
to him straight out let people think what they will of me it s
really all the same to me when my son s fate is at stake the
princess rose it s now two o clock and you dine at four there
will just be time 

and like a practical petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of
time anna mikh ylovna sent someone to call her son and went into the
anteroom with him 

 good by my dear said she to the countess who saw her to the
door and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear wish me
good luck 

 are you going to count cyril vlad mirovich my dear said the
count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom and he added 
 if he is better ask pierre to dine with us he has been to the
house you know and danced with the children be sure to invite him my
dear we will see how tar s distinguishes himself today he says count
orl v never gave such a dinner as ours will be 





chapter xv

 my dear bor s said princess anna mikh ylovna to her son as
countess rost va s carriage in which they were seated drove over the
straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of count cyril
vlad mirovich bez khov s house my dear bor s said the
mother drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying
it timidly and tenderly on her son s arm be affectionate and
attentive to him count cyril vlad mirovich is your godfather after
all and your future depends on him remember that my dear and be nice
to him as you so well know how to be 

 if only i knew that anything besides humiliation would come of
it answered her son coldly but i have promised and will do it
for your sake 

although the hall porter saw someone s carriage standing at the
entrance after scrutinizing the mother and son who without asking to
be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the
rows of statues in niches and looking significantly at the lady s old
cloak he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses and 
hearing that they wished to see the count said his excellency was worse
today and that his excellency was not receiving anyone 

 we may as well go back said the son in french 

 my dear exclaimed his mother imploringly again laying her hand
on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him 

bor s said no more but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking
off his cloak 

 my friend said anna mikh ylovna in gentle tones addressing
the hall porter i know count cyril vlad mirovich is very ill 
that s why i have come i am a relation i shall not disturb him 
my friend i only need see prince vas li serg evich he is staying
here is he not please announce me 

the hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs and turned
away 

 princess drubetsk ya to see prince vas li serg evich he called
to a footman dressed in knee breeches shoes and a swallow tail coat 
who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing 

the mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large
venetian mirror in the wall and in her trodden down shoes briskly
ascended the carpeted stairs 

 my dear she said to her son once more stimulating him by a
touch you promised me 

the son lowering his eyes followed her quietly 

they entered the large hall from which one of the doors led to the
apartments assigned to prince vas li 

just as the mother and son having reached the middle of the hall were
about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they
entered the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and prince vas li
came out wearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast 
as was his custom when at home taking leave of a good looking 
dark haired man this was the celebrated petersburg doctor lorrain 

 then it is certain said the prince 

 prince humanum est errare but replied the doctor 
swallowing his r s and pronouncing the latin words with a french
accent 

 to err is human 

 very well very well 

seeing anna mikh ylovna and her son prince vas li dismissed the
doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of
inquiry the son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly
clouded his mother s face and he smiled slightly 

 ah prince in what sad circumstances we meet again and how is our
dear invalid said she as though unaware of the cold offensive look
fixed on her 

prince vas li stared at her and at bor s questioningly and perplexed 
bor s bowed politely prince vas li without acknowledging the bow
turned to anna mikh ylovna answering her query by a movement of the
head and lips indicating very little hope for the patient 

 is it possible exclaimed anna mikh ylovna oh how awful 
it is terrible to think this is my son she added indicating
bor s he wanted to thank you himself 

bor s bowed again politely 

 believe me prince a mother s heart will never forget what you
have done for us 

 i am glad i was able to do you a service my dear anna
mikh ylovna said prince vas li arranging his lace frill and in
tone and manner here in moscow to anna mikh ylovna whom he had placed
under an obligation assuming an air of much greater importance than he
had done in petersburg at anna sch rer s reception 

 try to serve well and show yourself worthy added he addressing
bor s with severity i am glad are you here on leave he went
on in his usual tone of indifference 

 i am awaiting orders to join my new regiment your excellency 
replied bor s betraying neither annoyance at the prince s brusque
manner nor a desire to enter into conversation but speaking so quietly
and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance 

 are you living with your mother 

 i am living at countess rost va s replied bor s again
adding your excellency 

 that is with ily rost v who married nataly shinshin said
anna mikh ylovna 

 i know i know answered prince vas li in his monotonous voice 
 i never could understand how nataly made up her mind to marry that
unlicked bear a perfectly absurd and stupid fellow and a gambler too 
i am told 

 but a very kind man prince said anna mikh ylovna with a
pathetic smile as though she too knew that count rost v deserved this
censure but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man what
do the doctors say asked the princess after a pause her worn face
again expressing deep sorrow 

 they give little hope replied the prince 

 and i should so like to thank uncle once for all his kindness to me
and bor s he is his godson she added her tone suggesting that
this fact ought to give prince vas li much satisfaction 

prince vas li became thoughtful and frowned anna mikh ylovna saw that
he was afraid of finding in her a rival for count bez khov s fortune 
and hastened to reassure him 

 if it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to uncle 
said she uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern i
know his character noble upright but you see he has no one with
him except the young princesses they are still young she bent
her head and continued in a whisper has he performed his final duty 
prince how priceless are those last moments it can make things no
worse and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill 
we women prince and she smiled tenderly always know how to say
these things i absolutely must see him however painful it may be for
me i am used to suffering 

evidently the prince understood her and also understood as he had done
at anna p vlovna s that it would be difficult to get rid of anna
mikh ylovna 

 would not such a meeting be too trying for him dear anna
mikh ylovna said he let us wait until evening the doctors are
expecting a crisis 

 but one cannot delay prince at such a moment consider that the
welfare of his soul is at stake ah it is awful the duties of a
christian 

a door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses the
count s niece entered with a cold stern face the length of her
body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs prince vas li
turned to her 

 well how is he 

 still the same but what can you expect this noise said the
princess looking at anna mikh ylovna as at a stranger 

 ah my dear i hardly knew you said anna mikh ylovna with a
happy smile ambling lightly up to the count s niece i have come 
and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle i imagine what you
have gone through and she sympathetically turned up her eyes 

the princess gave no reply and did not even smile but left the room as
anna mikh ylovna took off her gloves and occupying the position she
had conquered settled down in an armchair inviting prince vas li to
take a seat beside her 

 bor s she said to her son with a smile i shall go in to see
the count my uncle but you my dear had better go to pierre meanwhile
and don t forget to give him the rost vs invitation they ask him
to dinner i suppose he won t go she continued turning to the
prince 

 on the contrary replied the prince who had plainly become
depressed i shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young
man here he is and the count has not once asked for him 

he shrugged his shoulders a footman conducted bor s down one flight of
stairs and up another to pierre s rooms 





chapter xvi

pierre after all had not managed to choose a career for himself in
petersburg and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and
sent to moscow the story told about him at count rost v s was true 
pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear he had now been
for some days in moscow and was staying as usual at his father s
house though he expected that the story of his escapade would be
already known in moscow and that the ladies about his father who were
never favorably disposed toward him would have used it to turn the
count against him he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to
his father s part of the house entering the drawing room where the
princesses spent most of their time he greeted the ladies two of whom
were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud it was the
eldest who was reading the one who had met anna mikh ylovna the
two younger ones were embroidering both were rosy and pretty and they
differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her
much prettier pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper 
the eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him
with frightened eyes the second assumed precisely the same expression 
while the youngest the one with the mole who was of a cheerful and
lively disposition bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked
by the amusing scene she foresaw she drew her wool down through the
canvas and scarcely able to refrain from laughing stooped as if trying
to make out the pattern 

 how do you do cousin said pierre you don t recognize
me 

 i recognize you only too well too well 

 how is the count can i see him asked pierre awkwardly as usual 
but unabashed 

 the count is suffering physically and mentally and apparently you
have done your best to increase his mental sufferings 

 can i see the count pierre again asked 

 hm if you wish to kill him to kill him outright you can see
him olga go and see whether uncle s beef tea is ready it is
almost time she added giving pierre to understand that they were
busy and busy making his father comfortable while evidently he 
pierre was only busy causing him annoyance 

olga went out pierre stood looking at the sisters then he bowed and
said then i will go to my rooms you will let me know when i can see
him 

and he left the room followed by the low but ringing laughter of the
sister with the mole 

next day prince vas li had arrived and settled in the count s house 
he sent for pierre and said to him my dear fellow if you are going
to behave here as you did in petersburg you will end very badly that
is all i have to say to you the count is very very ill and you must
not see him at all 

since then pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in
his rooms upstairs 

when bor s appeared at his door pierre was pacing up and down his room 
stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall 
as if running a sword through an invisible foe and glaring savagely
over his spectacles and then again resuming his walk muttering
indistinct words shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating 

 england is done for said he scowling and pointing his finger
at someone unseen mr pitt as a traitor to the nation and to the
rights of man is sentenced to but before pierre who at that
moment imagined himself to be napoleon in person and to have just
effected the dangerous crossing of the straits of dover and captured
london could pronounce pitt s sentence he saw a well built and
handsome young officer entering his room pierre paused he had left
moscow when bor s was a boy of fourteen and had quite forgotten him 
but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took bor s by the hand
with a friendly smile 

 do you remember me asked bor s quietly with a pleasant smile 
 i have come with my mother to see the count but it seems he is not
well 

 yes it seems he is ill people are always disturbing him 
answered pierre trying to remember who this young man was 

bor s felt that pierre did not recognize him but did not consider
it necessary to introduce himself and without experiencing the least
embarrassment looked pierre straight in the face 

 count rost v asks you to come to dinner today said he after a
considerable pause which made pierre feel uncomfortable 

 ah count rost v exclaimed pierre joyfully then you are his
son ily only fancy i didn t know you at first do you remember
how we went to the sparrow hills with madame jacquot it s such an
age 

 you are mistaken said bor s deliberately with a bold and
slightly sarcastic smile i am bor s son of princess anna
mikh ylovna drubetsk ya rost v the father is ily and his son is
nicholas i never knew any madame jacquot 

pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees 

 oh dear what am i thinking about i ve mixed everything up one
has so many relatives in moscow so you are bor s of course well now
we know where we are and what do you think of the boulogne expedition 
the english will come off badly you know if napoleon gets across the
channel i think the expedition is quite feasible if only villeneuve
doesn t make a mess of things 

bor s knew nothing about the boulogne expedition he did not read the
papers and it was the first time he had heard villeneuve s name 

 we here in moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal
than with politics said he in his quiet ironical tone i know
nothing about it and have not thought about it moscow is chiefly busy
with gossip he continued just now they are talking about you and
your father 

pierre smiled in his good natured way as if afraid for his companion s
sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret 
but bor s spoke distinctly clearly and dryly looking straight into
pierre s eyes 

 moscow has nothing else to do but gossip bor s went on 
 everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune 
though he may perhaps outlive us all as i sincerely hope he will 

 yes it is all very horrid interrupted pierre very horrid 

pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say
something disconcerting to himself 

 and it must seem to you said bor s flushing slightly but not
changing his tone or attitude it must seem to you that everyone is
trying to get something out of the rich man 

 so it does thought pierre 

 but i just wish to say to avoid misunderstandings that you are
quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people we are
very poor but for my own part at any rate for the very reason that
your father is rich i don t regard myself as a relation of his and
neither i nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him 

for a long time pierre could not understand but when he did he jumped
up from the sofa seized bor s under the elbow in his quick clumsy
way and blushing far more than bor s began to speak with a feeling
of mingled shame and vexation 

 well this is strange do you suppose i who could think i know
very well 

but bor s again interrupted him 

 i am glad i have spoken out fully perhaps you did not like it you
must excuse me said he putting pierre at ease instead of being put
at ease by him but i hope i have not offended you i always make it
a rule to speak out well what answer am i to take will you come to
dinner at the rost vs 

and bor s having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and
extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it 
became quite pleasant again 

 no but i say said pierre calming down you are a wonderful
fellow what you have just said is good very good of course you
don t know me we have not met for such a long time not since we
were children you might think that i i understand quite understand 
i could not have done it myself i should not have had the courage but
it s splendid i am very glad to have made your acquaintance it s
queer he added after a pause that you should have suspected
me he began to laugh well what of it i hope we ll get better
acquainted and he pressed bor s hand do you know i have not
once been in to see the count he has not sent for me i am sorry for
him as a man but what can one do 

 and so you think napoleon will manage to get an army across asked
bor s with a smile 

pierre saw that bor s wished to change the subject and being of the
same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the
boulogne expedition 

a footman came in to summon bor s the princess was going pierre in
order to make bor s better acquaintance promised to come to dinner 
and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles
into bor s eyes after he had gone pierre continued pacing up and
down the room for a long time no longer piercing an imaginary foe with
his imaginary sword but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant 
intelligent and resolute young man 

as often happens in early youth especially to one who leads a lonely
life he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up
his mind that they would be friends 

prince vas li saw the princess off she held a handkerchief to her eyes
and her face was tearful 

 it is dreadful dreadful she was saying but cost me what it
may i shall do my duty i will come and spend the night he must not be
left like this every moment is precious i can t think why his nieces
put it off perhaps god will help me to find a way to prepare him 
adieu prince may god support you 

 adieu ma bonne answered prince vas li turning away from her 

 oh he is in a dreadful state said the mother to her son when
they were in the carriage he hardly recognizes anybody 

 i don t understand mamma what is his attitude to pierre 
asked the son 

 the will will show that my dear our fate also depends on it 

 but why do you expect that he will leave us anything 

 ah my dear he is so rich and we are so poor 

 well that is hardly a sufficient reason mamma 

 oh heaven how ill he is exclaimed the mother 





chapter xvii

after anna mikh ylovna had driven off with her son to visit count cyril
vlad mirovich bez khov countess rost va sat for a long time all
alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes at last she rang 

 what is the matter with you my dear she said crossly to the maid
who kept her waiting some minutes don t you wish to serve me then
i ll find you another place 

the countess was upset by her friend s sorrow and humiliating poverty 
and was therefore out of sorts a state of mind which with her always
found expression in calling her maid my dear and speaking to her
with exaggerated politeness 

 i am very sorry ma am answered the maid 

 ask the count to come to me 

the count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as
usual 

 well little countess what a saut of game au mad re we are to
have my dear i tasted it the thousand rubles i paid for tar s were
not ill spent he is worth it 

he sat down by his wife his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling
his gray hair 

 what are your commands little countess 

 you see my dear what s that mess she said pointing to his
waistcoat it s the saut most likely she added with a smile 
 well you see count i want some money 

her face became sad 

 oh little countess and the count began bustling to get out
his pocketbook 

 i want a great deal count i want five hundred rubles and taking
out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husband s waistcoat 

 yes immediately immediately hey who s there he called out
in a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will
rush to obey the summons send dm tri to me 

dm tri a man of good family who had been brought up in the count s
house and now managed all his affairs stepped softly into the room 

 this is what i want my dear fellow said the count to the
deferential young man who had entered bring me he reflected
a moment yes bring me seven hundred rubles yes but mind don t
bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time but nice clean ones
for the countess 

 yes dm tri clean ones please said the countess sighing
deeply 

 when would you like them your excellency asked dm tri allow
me to inform you but don t be uneasy he added noticing that
the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always
a sign of approaching anger i was forgetting do you wish it
brought at once 

 yes yes just so bring it give it to the countess 

 what a treasure that dm tri is added the count with a smile when
the young man had departed there is never any impossible with
him that s a thing i hate everything is possible 

 ah money count money how much sorrow it causes in the world 
said the countess but i am in great need of this sum 

 you my little countess are a notorious spendthrift said the
count and having kissed his wife s hand he went back to his study 

when anna mikh ylovna returned from count bez khov s the money all
in clean notes was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess 
little table and anna mikh ylovna noticed that something was agitating
her 

 well my dear asked the countess 

 oh what a terrible state he is in one would not know him he is so
ill i was only there a few moments and hardly said a word 

 annette for heaven s sake don t refuse me the countess
began with a blush that looked very strange on her thin dignified 
elderly face and she took the money from under the handkerchief 

anna mikh ylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be
ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment 

 this is for bor s from me for his outfit 

anna mikh ylovna was already embracing her and weeping the countess
wept too they wept because they were friends and because they were
kindhearted and because they friends from childhood had to think
about such a base thing as money and because their youth was over 
but those tears were pleasant to them both 





chapter xviii

countess rost va with her daughters and a large number of guests was
already seated in the drawing room the count took the gentlemen into
his study and showed them his choice collection of turkish pipes from
time to time he went out to ask hasn t she come yet they
were expecting m rya dm trievna akhros mova known in society as le
terrible dragon a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank but for
common sense and frank plainness of speech m rya dm trievna was known
to the imperial family as well as to all moscow and petersburg and both
cities wondered at her laughed privately at her rudenesses and told
good stories about her while none the less all without exception
respected and feared her 

in the count s room which was full of tobacco smoke they talked
of the war that had been announced in a manifesto and about the
recruiting none of them had yet seen the manifesto but they all knew
it had appeared the count sat on the sofa between two guests who were
smoking and talking he neither smoked nor talked but bending his head
first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident
pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors whom he
egged on against each other 

one of them was a sallow clean shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled
face already growing old though he was dressed like a most fashionable
young man he sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and 
having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth was inhaling the
smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes this was an old bachelor 
shinsh n a cousin of the countess a man with a sharp tongue 
as they said in moscow society he seemed to be condescending to
his companion the latter a fresh rosy officer of the guards 
irreproachably washed brushed and buttoned held his pipe in the
middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke letting
it escape from his handsome mouth in rings this was lieutenant berg an
officer in the sem nov regiment with whom bor s was to travel to join
the army and about whom nat sha had teased her elder sister v ra 
speaking of berg as her intended the count sat between them and
listened attentively his favorite occupation when not playing boston a
card game he was very fond of was that of listener especially when he
succeeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another 

 well then old chap mon tr s honorable alphonse k rlovich 
said shinsh n laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary russian
expressions with the choicest french phrases which was a peculiarity
of his speech vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur l tat 
you want to make something out of your company 

 you expect to make an income out of the government 

 no peter nikol evich i only want to show that in the cavalry
the advantages are far less than in the infantry just consider my own
position now peter nikol evich 

berg always spoke quietly politely and with great precision his
conversation always related entirely to himself he would remain calm
and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing
on himself he could remain silent for hours without being at all put
out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable but as
soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk
circumstantially and with evident satisfaction 

 consider my position peter nikol evich were i in the cavalry i
should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months even
with the rank of lieutenant but as it is i receive two hundred and
thirty said he looking at shinsh n and the count with a joyful 
pleasant smile as if it were obvious to him that his success must
always be the chief desire of everyone else 

 besides that peter nikol evich by exchanging into the guards
i shall be in a more prominent position continued berg and
vacancies occur much more frequently in the foot guards then just think
what can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles i even manage to
put a little aside and to send something to my father he went on 
emitting a smoke ring 

 la balance y est a german knows how to skin a flint as the
proverb says remarked shinsh n moving his pipe to the other side
of his mouth and winking at the count 

 so that squares matters 

the count burst out laughing the other guests seeing that shinsh n
was talking came up to listen berg oblivious of irony or indifference 
continued to explain how by exchanging into the guards he had already
gained a step on his old comrades of the cadet corps how in wartime
the company commander might get killed and he as senior in the company 
might easily succeed to the post how popular he was with everyone in
the regiment and how satisfied his father was with him berg evidently
enjoyed narrating all this and did not seem to suspect that others 
too might have their own interests but all he said was so prettily
sedate and the na vet of his youthful egotism was so obvious that
he disarmed his hearers 

 well my boy you ll get along wherever you go foot or
horse that i ll warrant said shinsh n patting him on the
shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa 

berg smiled joyously the count followed by his guests went into the
drawing room 

it was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests 
expecting the summons to zak ska avoid engaging in any long
conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk in order
to show that they are not at all impatient for their food the host and
hostess look toward the door and now and then glance at one another 
and the visitors try to guess from these glances who or what they are
waiting for some important relation who has not yet arrived or a dish
that is not yet ready 

 hors d oeuvres 

pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the
middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across 
blocking the way for everyone the countess tried to make him talk 
but he went on na vely looking around through his spectacles as if in
search of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables he
was in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact most of
the guests knowing of the affair with the bear looked with curiosity
at this big stout quiet man wondering how such a clumsy modest
fellow could have played such a prank on a policeman 

 you have only lately arrived the countess asked him 

 oui madame replied he looking around him 

 you have not yet seen my husband 

 non madame he smiled quite inappropriately 

 you have been in paris recently i believe i suppose it s very
interesting 

 very interesting 

the countess exchanged glances with anna mikh ylovna the latter
understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man and
sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father but he
answered her as he had the countess only in monosyllables the other
guests were all conversing with one another the razum vskis it
was charming you are very kind countess apr ksina was heard
on all sides the countess rose and went into the ballroom 

 m rya dm trievna came her voice from there 

 herself came the answer in a rough voice and m rya dm trievna
entered the room 

all the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very
oldest rose m rya dm trievna paused at the door tall and stout 
holding high her fifty year old head with its gray curls she stood
surveying the guests and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if
rolling them up m rya dm trievna always spoke in russian 

 health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her
children she said in her loud full toned voice which drowned all
others well you old sinner she went on turning to the count
who was kissing her hand you re feeling dull in moscow i daresay 
nowhere to hunt with your dogs but what is to be done old man just
see how these nestlings are growing up and she pointed to the girls 
 you must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not 

 well said she how s my cossack m rya dm trievna
always called nat sha a cossack and she stroked the child s arm as
she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand i know she s a scamp
of a girl but i like her 

she took a pair of pear shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and 
having given them to the rosy nat sha who beamed with the pleasure
of her saint s day fete turned away at once and addressed herself to
pierre 

 eh eh friend come here a bit said she assuming a soft high
tone of voice come here my friend and she ominously tucked
up her sleeves still higher pierre approached looking at her in a
childlike way through his spectacles 

 come nearer come nearer friend i used to be the only one to tell
your father the truth when he was in favor and in your case it s my
evident duty she paused all were silent expectant of what was to
follow for this was clearly only a prelude 

 a fine lad my word a fine lad his father lies on his deathbed
and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear for shame 
sir for shame it would be better if you went to the war 

she turned away and gave her hand to the count who could hardly keep
from laughing 

 well i suppose it is time we were at table said m rya
dm trievna 

the count went in first with m rya dm trievna the countess followed
on the arm of a colonel of hussars a man of importance to them because
nicholas was to go with him to the regiment then came anna mikh ylovna
with shinsh n berg gave his arm to v ra the smiling julie kar gina
went in with nicholas after them other couples followed filling the
whole dining hall and last of all the children tutors and governesses
followed singly the footmen began moving about chairs scraped the
band struck up in the gallery and the guests settled down in their
places then the strains of the count s household band were replaced
by the clatter of knives and forks the voices of visitors and the
soft steps of the footmen at one end of the table sat the countess with
m rya dm trievna on her right and anna mikh ylovna on her left the
other lady visitors were farther down at the other end sat the count 
with the hussar colonel on his left and shinsh n and the other male
visitors on his right midway down the long table on one side sat the
grown up young people v ra beside berg and pierre beside bor s and
on the other side the children tutors and governesses from behind
the crystal decanters and fruit vases the count kept glancing at his
wife and her tall cap with its light blue ribbons and busily filled
his neighbors glasses not neglecting his own the countess in turn 
without omitting her duties as hostess threw significant glances from
behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed
by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair at the
ladies end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time at the
men s end the voices sounded louder and louder especially that of the
colonel of hussars who growing more and more flushed ate and drank so
much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests berg
with tender smiles was saying to v ra that love is not an earthly but
a heavenly feeling bor s was telling his new friend pierre who the
guests were and exchanging glances with nat sha who was sitting
opposite pierre spoke little but examined the new faces and ate a
great deal of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and
went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines 
these latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward wrapped in a
napkin from behind the next man s shoulders and whispered dry
madeira hungarian or rhine wine as the case might
be of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count s monogram
that stood before his plate pierre held out one at random and drank
with enjoyment gazing with ever increasing amiability at the other
guests nat sha who sat opposite was looking at bor s as girls of
thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for
the first time sometimes that same look fell on pierre and that funny
lively little girl s look made him inclined to laugh without knowing
why 

nicholas sat at some distance from s nya beside julie kar gina to
whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile s nya wore
a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy now she turned
pale now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what nicholas
and julie were saying to one another the governess kept looking round
uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the
children the german tutor was trying to remember all the dishes wines 
and kinds of dessert in order to send a full description of the dinner
to his people in germany and he felt greatly offended when the butler
with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by he frowned trying to
appear as if he did not want any of that wine but was mortified because
no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from
greediness that he wanted it but simply from a conscientious desire for
knowledge 





chapter xix

at the men s end of the table the talk grew more and more animated 
the colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared
in petersburg and that a copy which he had himself seen had that day
been forwarded by courier to the commander in chief 

 and why the deuce are we going to fight bonaparte remarked
shinsh n he has stopped austria s cackle and i fear it will be
our turn next 

the colonel was a stout tall plethoric german evidently devoted to
the service and patriotically russian he resented shinsh n s remark 

 it is for the reasson my goot sir said he speaking with a
german accent for the reasson zat ze emperor knows zat he
declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger
vreatening russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze empire as vell
as ze sanctity of its alliances he spoke this last word with
particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter 

then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he
repeated from the opening words of the manifesto 

 and the wish which constitutes the emperor s sole and absolute
aim to establish peace in europe on firm foundations has now decided
him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition
for the attainment of that purpose 

 zat my dear sir is vy he concluded drinking a tumbler of
wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval 

 connaissez vous le proverbe jerome jerome do not roam but
turn spindles at home said shinsh n puckering his brows and
smiling cela nous convient merveille 2 suv rov now he knew
what he was about yet they beat him plate couture 3 and where
are we to find suv rovs now je vous demande un peu 4 said he 
continually changing from french to russian 

 do you know the proverb 

 2 that suits us down to the ground 

 3 hollow 

 4 i just ask you that 

 ve must vight to the last tr r op of our plood said the colonel 
thumping the table and ve must tie for our emperor and zen all vill
pe vell and ve must discuss it as little as po o ossible he dwelt
particularly on the word possible as po o ossible he ended 
again turning to the count zat is how ve old hussars look at it and
zere s an end of it and how do you a young man and a young hussar 
how do you judge of it he added addressing nicholas who when he
heard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with
eyes and ears intent on the colonel 

 i am quite of your opinion replied nicholas flaming up turning
his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision
and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great
danger i am convinced that we russians must die or conquer he
concluded conscious as were others after the words were uttered
that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and
were therefore awkward 

 what you said just now was splendid said his partner julie 

s nya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and
down to her neck and shoulders while nicholas was speaking 

pierre listened to the colonel s speech and nodded approvingly 

 that s fine said he 

 the young man s a real hussar shouted the colonel again
thumping the table 

 what are you making such a noise about over there m rya
dm trievna s deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the
table what are you thumping the table for she demanded of the
hussar and why are you exciting yourself do you think the french
are here 

 i am speaking ze truce replied the hussar with a smile 

 it s all about the war the count shouted down the table you
know my son s going m rya dm trievna my son is going 

 i have four sons in the army but still i don t fret it is all
in god s hands you may die in your bed or god may spare you in a
battle replied m rya dm trievna s deep voice which easily
carried the whole length of the table 

 that s true 

once more the conversations concentrated the ladies at the one end
and the men s at the other 

 you won t ask nat sha s little brother was saying i know
you won t ask 

 i will replied nat sha 

her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution she half
rose by a glance inviting pierre who sat opposite to listen to what
was coming and turning to her mother 

 mamma rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice 
audible the whole length of the table 

 what is it asked the countess startled but seeing by her
daughter s face that it was only mischief she shook a finger at her
sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head 

the conversation was hushed 

 mamma what sweets are we going to have and nat sha s voice
sounded still more firm and resolute 

the countess tried to frown but could not m rya dm trievna shook her
fat finger 

 cossack she said threateningly 

most of the guests uncertain how to regard this sally looked at the
elders 

 you had better take care said the countess 

 mamma what sweets are we going to have nat sha again cried
boldly with saucy gaiety confident that her prank would be taken in
good part 

s nya and fat little p tya doubled up with laughter 

 you see i have asked whispered nat sha to her little brother
and to pierre glancing at him again 

 ice pudding but you won t get any said m rya dm trievna 

nat sha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even
m rya dm trievna 

 m rya dm trievna what kind of ice pudding i don t like ice
cream 

 carrot ices 

 no what kind m rya dm trievna what kind she almost screamed 
 i want to know 

m rya dm trievna and the countess burst out laughing and all the
guests joined in everyone laughed not at m rya dm trievna s answer
but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had
dared to treat m rya dm trievna in this fashion 

nat sha only desisted when she had been told that there would be
pineapple ice before the ices champagne was served round the band
again struck up the count and countess kissed and the guests leaving
their seats went up to congratulate the countess and reached
across the table to clink glasses with the count with the children and
with one another again the footmen rushed about chairs scraped and
in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces the
guests returned to the drawing room and to the count s study 





chapter xx

the card tables were drawn out sets made up for boston and the
count s visitors settled themselves some in the two drawing rooms 
some in the sitting room some in the library 

the count holding his cards fanwise kept himself with difficulty from
dropping into his usual after dinner nap and laughed at everything 
the young people at the countess instigation gathered round the
clavichord and harp julie by general request played first after she
had played a little air with variations on the harp she joined the
other young ladies in begging nat sha and nicholas who were noted for
their musical talent to sing something nat sha who was treated as
though she were grown up was evidently very proud of this but at the
same time felt shy 

 what shall we sing she said 

 the brook suggested nicholas 

 well then let s be quick bor s come here said nat sha 
 but where is s nya 

she looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to
look for her 

running into s nya s room and not finding her there nat sha ran to
the nursery but s nya was not there either nat sha concluded that
she must be on the chest in the passage the chest in the passage was
the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the rost v
household and there in fact was s nya lying face downward on nurse s
dirty feather bed on the top of the chest crumpling her gauzy pink
dress under her hiding her face with her slender fingers and sobbing
so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook nat sha s
face which had been so radiantly happy all that saint s day suddenly
changed her eyes became fixed and then a shiver passed down her broad
neck and the corners of her mouth drooped 

 s nya what is it what is the matter oo oo oo and
nat sha s large mouth widened making her look quite ugly and she
began to wail like a baby without knowing why except that s nya was
crying s nya tried to lift her head to answer but could not and
hid her face still deeper in the bed nat sha wept sitting on the
blue striped feather bed and hugging her friend with an effort s nya
sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining 

 nicholas is going away in a week s time his papers have
come he told me himself but still i should not cry and she
showed a paper she held in her hand with the verses nicholas had
written still i should not cry but you can t no one can
understand what a soul he has 

and she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul 

 it s all very well for you i am not envious i love you and
bor s also she went on gaining a little strength he is nice 
there are no difficulties in your way but nicholas is my cousin 
one would have to the metropolitan himself and even then it
can t be done and besides if she tells mamma s nya looked upon
the countess as her mother and called her so that i am spoiling
nicholas career and am heartless and ungrateful while truly god
is my witness and she made the sign of the cross i love her so
much and all of you only v ra and what for what have i done
to her i am so grateful to you that i would willingly sacrifice
everything only i have nothing 

s nya could not continue and again hid her face in her hands and in
the feather bed nat sha began consoling her but her face showed that
she understood all the gravity of her friend s trouble 

 s nya she suddenly exclaimed as if she had guessed the true
reason of her friend s sorrow i m sure v ra has said something
to you since dinner hasn t she 

 yes these verses nicholas wrote himself and i copied some others 
and she found them on my table and said she d show them to mamma and
that i was ungrateful and that mamma would never allow him to marry
me but that he ll marry julie you see how he s been with her all
day nat sha what have i done to deserve it 

and again she began to sob more bitterly than before nat sha lifted
her up hugged her and smiling through her tears began comforting
her 

 s nya don t believe her darling don t believe her do you
remember how we and nicholas all three of us talked in the sitting
room after supper why we settled how everything was to be i don t
quite remember how but don t you remember that it could all be
arranged and how nice it all was there s uncle shinsh n s brother
has married his first cousin and we are only second cousins you know 
and bor s says it is quite possible you know i have told him all about
it and he is so clever and so good said nat sha don t
you cry s nya dear love darling s nya and she kissed her and
laughed v ra s spiteful never mind her and all will come right
and she won t say anything to mamma nicholas will tell her himself 
and he doesn t care at all for julie 

nat sha kissed her on the hair 

s nya sat up the little kitten brightened its eyes shone and it
seemed ready to lift its tail jump down on its soft paws and begin
playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should 

 do you think so really truly she said quickly smoothing her
frock and hair 

 really truly answered nat sha pushing in a crisp lock that had
strayed from under her friend s plaits 

both laughed 

 well let s go and sing the brook 

 come along 

 do you know that fat pierre who sat opposite me is so funny said
nat sha stopping suddenly i feel so happy 

and she set off at a run along the passage 

s nya shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the
verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest ran
after nat sha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face
and light joyous steps at the visitors request the young people
sang the quartette the brook with which everyone was delighted 
then nicholas sang a song he had just learned 

 at nighttime in the moon s fair glow
 how sweet as fancies wander free 
 to feel that in this world there s one
 who still is thinking but of thee 

 that while her fingers touch the harp
 wafting sweet music o er the lea 
 it is for thee thus swells her heart 
 sighing its message out to thee 

 a day or two then bliss unspoilt 
 but oh till then i cannot live 

he had not finished the last verse before the young people began to
get ready to dance in the large hall and the sound of the feet and the
coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery 


pierre was sitting in the drawing room where shinsh n had engaged him 
as a man recently returned from abroad in a political conversation in
which several others joined but which bored pierre when the music began
nat sha came in and walking straight up to pierre said laughing and
blushing 

 mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers 

 i am afraid of mixing the figures pierre replied but if you
will be my teacher and lowering his big arm he offered it to the
slender little girl 

while the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up 
pierre sat down with his little partner nat sha was perfectly happy 
she was dancing with a grown up man who had been abroad she was
sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown up lady 
she had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold 
assuming quite the pose of a society woman heaven knows when and where
she had learned it she talked with her partner fanning herself and
smiling over the fan 

 dear dear just look at her exclaimed the countess as she
crossed the ballroom pointing to nat sha 

nat sha blushed and laughed 

 well really mamma why should you what is there to be surprised
at 


in the midst of the third cossaise there was a clatter of chairs being
pushed back in the sitting room where the count and m rya dm trievna
had been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and
older visitors they now stretching themselves after sitting so long 
and replacing their purses and pocketbooks entered the ballroom first
came m rya dm trievna and the count both with merry countenances the
count with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style offered his
bent arm to m rya dm trievna he drew himself up a smile of debonair
gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the
 cossaise was ended he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted
up to their gallery addressing the first violin 

 sem n do you know the daniel cooper 

this was the count s favorite dance which he had danced in his youth 
 strictly speaking daniel cooper was one figure of the anglaise 

 look at papa shouted nat sha to the whole company and quite
forgetting that she was dancing with a grown up partner she bent her
curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter 

and indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the
jovial old gentleman who standing beside his tall and stout partner 
m rya dm trievna curved his arms beat time straightened his
shoulders turned out his toes tapped gently with his foot and by
a smile that broadened his round face more and more prepared the
onlookers for what was to follow as soon as the provocatively gay
strains of daniel cooper somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant
dance began to sound all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly
filled by the domestic serfs the men on one side and the women on
the other who with beaming faces had come to see their master making
merry 

 just look at the master a regular eagle he is loudly remarked
the nurse as she stood in one of the doorways 

the count danced well and knew it but his partner could not and did not
want to dance well her enormous figure stood erect her powerful arms
hanging down she had handed her reticule to the countess and only her
stern but handsome face really joined in the dance what was expressed
by the whole of the count s plump figure in m rya dm trievna found
expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose 
but if the count getting more and more into the swing of it charmed
the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and
the agility with which he capered about on his light feet m rya
dm trievna produced no less impression by slight exertions the least
effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning or stamp
her foot which everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual
severity the dance grew livelier and livelier the other couples could
not attract a moment s attention to their own evolutions and did not
even try to do so all were watching the count and m rya dm trievna 
nat sha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress urging them to
 look at papa though as it was they never took their eyes off the
couple in the intervals of the dance the count breathing deeply waved
and shouted to the musicians to play faster faster faster and faster 
lightly more lightly and yet more lightly whirled the count flying
round m rya dm trievna now on his toes now on his heels until 
turning his partner round to her seat he executed the final pas 
raising his soft foot backwards bowing his perspiring head smiling
and making a wide sweep with his arm amid a thunder of applause and
laughter led by nat sha both partners stood still breathing heavily
and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs

chapter xxi

while in the rost vs ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced 
to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered and while tired
footmen and cooks were getting the supper count bez khov had a
sixth stroke the doctors pronounced recovery impossible after a mute
confession communion was administered to the dying man preparations
made for the sacrament of unction and in his house there was the bustle
and thrill of suspense usual at such moments outside the house beyond
the gates a group of undertakers who hid whenever a carriage drove up 
waited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral 
the military governor of moscow who had been assiduous in sending
aides de camp to inquire after the count s health came himself
that evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of
catherine s court count bez khov 

the magnificent reception room was crowded everyone stood up
respectfully when the military governor having stayed about half an
hour alone with the dying man passed out slightly acknowledging their
bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed
on him by the doctors clergy and relatives of the family prince
vas li who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days 
escorted him to the door repeating something to him several times in
low tones 

when the military governor had gone prince vas li sat down all alone
on a chair in the ballroom crossing one leg high over the other 
leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand after
sitting so for a while he rose and looking about him with frightened
eyes went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading
to the back of the house to the room of the eldest princess 

those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous
whispers and whenever anyone went into or came from the dying man s
room grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at
his door which creaked slightly when opened 

 the limits of human life are fixed and may not be
o erpassed said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat
beside him and was listening na vely to his words 

 i wonder is it not too late to administer unction asked the
lady adding the priest s clerical title as if she had no opinion of
her own on the subject 

 ah madam it is a great sacrament replied the priest passing
his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his
bald head 

 who was that the military governor himself was being asked at
the other side of the room how young looking he is 

 yes and he is over sixty i hear the count no longer recognizes
anyone they wished to administer the sacrament of unction 

 i knew someone who received that sacrament seven times 

the second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red
from weeping and sat down beside dr lorrain who was sitting in a
graceful pose under a portrait of catherine leaning his elbow on a
table 

 beautiful said the doctor in answer to a remark about the
weather the weather is beautiful princess and besides in moscow
one feels as if one were in the country 

 yes indeed replied the princess with a sigh so he may have
something to drink 

lorrain considered 

 has he taken his medicine 

 yes 

the doctor glanced at his watch 

 take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar 
and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch 

 dere has neffer been a gase a german doctor was saying to an
aide de camp dat one liffs after de sird stroke 

 and what a well preserved man he was remarked the aide de camp 
 and who will inherit his wealth he added in a whisper 

 it von t go begging replied the german with a smile 

everyone again looked toward the door which creaked as the second
princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to
lorrain s instructions the german doctor went up to lorrain 

 do you think he can last till morning asked the german 
addressing lorrain in french which he pronounced badly 

lorrain pursing up his lips waved a severely negative finger before
his nose 

 tonight not later said he in a low voice and he moved away
with a decorous smile of self satisfaction at being able clearly to
understand and state the patient s condition 

meanwhile prince vas li had opened the door into the princess room 

in this room it was almost dark only two tiny lamps were burning before
the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles 
the room was crowded with small pieces of furniture whatnots 
cupboards and little tables the quilt of a high white feather bed was
just visible behind a screen a small dog began to bark 

 ah is it you cousin 

she rose and smoothed her hair which was as usual so extremely smooth
that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with
varnish 

 has anything happened she asked i am so terrified 

 no there is no change i only came to have a talk about business 
catiche muttered the prince seating himself wearily on the chair
she had just vacated you have made the place warm i must say he
remarked well sit down let s have a talk 

 catherine 

 i thought perhaps something had happened she said with her
unchanging stonily severe expression and sitting down opposite the
prince she prepared to listen 

 i wished to get a nap mon cousin but i can t 

 well my dear said prince vas li taking her hand and bending it
downwards as was his habit 

it was plain that this well referred to much that they both
understood without naming 

the princess who had a straight rigid body abnormally long for her
legs looked directly at prince vas li with no sign of emotion in her
prominent gray eyes then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons
with a sigh this might have been taken as an expression of sorrow
and devotion or of weariness and hope of resting before long prince
vas li understood it as an expression of weariness 

 and i he said do you think it is easier for me i am as worn
out as a post horse but still i must have a talk with you catiche a
very serious talk 

prince vas li said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously 
now on one side now on the other giving his face an unpleasant
expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room his eyes
too seemed strange at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the
next glanced round in alarm 

the princess holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony
hands looked attentively into prince vas li s eyes evidently
resolved not to be the first to break silence if she had to wait till
morning 

 well you see my dear princess and cousin catherine sem novna 
continued prince vas li returning to his theme apparently not
without an inner struggle at such a moment as this one must think
of everything one must think of the future of all of you i love you
all like children of my own as you know 

the princess continued to look at him without moving and with the same
dull expression 

 and then of course my family has also to be considered prince
vas li went on testily pushing away a little table without looking at
her you know catiche that we you three sisters m montov and
my wife are the count s only direct heirs i know i know how hard
it is for you to talk or think of such matters it is no easier for
me but my dear i am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for
anything do you know i have sent for pierre the count pointing to
his portrait definitely demanded that he should be called 

prince vas li looked questioningly at the princess but could not make
out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was
simply looking at him 

 there is one thing i constantly pray god to grant mon cousin she
replied and it is that he would be merciful to him and would allow
his noble soul peacefully to leave this 

 yes yes of course interrupted prince vas li impatiently 
rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little
table that he had pushed away but in short the fact is you
know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left
all his property not to us his direct heirs but to pierre 

 he has made wills enough quietly remarked the princess but he
cannot leave the estate to pierre pierre is illegitimate 

 but my dear said prince vas li suddenly clutching the little
table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly what if
a letter has been written to the emperor in which the count asks for
pierre s legitimation do you understand that in consideration of the
count s services his request would be granted 

the princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the
subject under discussion than those they are talking with 

 i can tell you more continued prince vas li seizing her hand 
 that letter was written though it was not sent and the emperor knew
of it the only question is has it been destroyed or not if not then
as soon as all is over and prince vas li sighed to intimate what he
meant by the words all is over and the count s papers are opened 
the will and letter will be delivered to the emperor and the petition
will certainly be granted pierre will get everything as the legitimate
son 

 and our share asked the princess smiling ironically as if
anything might happen only not that 

 but my poor catiche it is as clear as daylight he will then be the
legal heir to everything and you won t get anything you must know 
my dear whether the will and letter were written and whether they have
been destroyed or not and if they have somehow been overlooked you
ought to know where they are and must find them because 

 what next the princess interrupted smiling sardonically and not
changing the expression of her eyes i am a woman and you think we
are all stupid but i know this an illegitimate son cannot inherit 
un b tard she added as if supposing that this translation of the
word would effectively prove to prince vas li the invalidity of his
contention 

 a bastard 

 well really catiche can t you understand you are so
intelligent how is it you don t see that if the count has written a
letter to the emperor begging him to recognize pierre as legitimate it
follows that pierre will not be pierre but will become count bez khov 
and will then inherit everything under the will and if the will and
letter are not destroyed then you will have nothing but the consolation
of having been dutiful et tout ce qui s ensuit that s certain 

 and all that follows therefrom 

 i know the will was made but i also know that it is invalid 
and you mon cousin seem to consider me a perfect fool said the
princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are
saying something witty and stinging 

 my dear princess catherine sem novna began prince vas li
impatiently i came here not to wrangle with you but to talk about
your interests as with a kinswoman a good kind true relation and i
tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the emperor and the
will in pierre s favor are among the count s papers then my dear
girl you and your sisters are not heiresses if you don t believe me 
then believe an expert i have just been talking to dm tri on frich 
 the family solicitor and he says the same 

at this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess ideas 
her thin lips grew white though her eyes did not change and her voice
when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself
evidently did not expect 

 that would be a fine thing said she i never wanted anything
and i don t now 

she pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress 

 and this is gratitude this is recognition for those who have
sacrificed everything for his sake she cried it s splendid 
fine i don t want anything prince 

 yes but you are not the only one there are your sisters 
replied prince vas li 

but the princess did not listen to him 

 yes i knew it long ago but had forgotten i knew that i could expect
nothing but meanness deceit envy intrigue and ingratitude the
blackest ingratitude in this house 

 do you or do you not know where that will is insisted prince
vas li his cheeks twitching more than ever 

 yes i was a fool i still believed in people loved them and
sacrificed myself but only the base the vile succeed i know who has
been intriguing 

the princess wished to rise but the prince held her by the hand she
had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race 
she gave her companion an angry glance 

 there is still time my dear you must remember catiche that it was
all done casually in a moment of anger of illness and was afterwards
forgotten our duty my dear is to rectify his mistake to ease his
last moments by not letting him commit this injustice and not to let
him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who 

 who sacrificed everything for him chimed in the princess who
would again have risen had not the prince still held her fast though
he never could appreciate it no mon cousin she added with a sigh 
 i shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward 
that in this world there is neither honor nor justice in this world one
has to be cunning and cruel 

 now come come be reasonable i know your excellent heart 

 no i have a wicked heart 

 i know your heart repeated the prince i value your friendship
and wish you to have as good an opinion of me don t upset yourself 
and let us talk sensibly while there is still time be it a day or be it
but an hour tell me all you know about the will and above all where
it is you must know we will take it at once and show it to the
count he has no doubt forgotten it and will wish to destroy it 
you understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his
wishes that is my only reason for being here i came simply to help him
and you 

 now i see it all i know who has been intriguing i know cried
the princess 

 that s not the point my dear 

 it s that prot g of yours that sweet princess drubetsk ya 
that anna mikh ylovna whom i would not take for a housemaid the
infamous vile woman 

 do not let us lose any time 

 ah don t talk to me last winter she wheedled herself in here and
told the count such vile disgraceful things about us especially about
sophie i can t repeat them that it made the count quite ill and he
would not see us for a whole fortnight i know it was then he wrote this
vile infamous paper but i thought the thing was invalid 

 we ve got to it at last why did you not tell me about it
sooner 

 it s in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow 
said the princess ignoring his question now i know yes if i have
a sin a great sin it is hatred of that vile woman almost shrieked
the princess now quite changed and what does she come worming
herself in here for but i will give her a piece of my mind the time
will come 





chapter xxii

while these conversations were going on in the reception room and the
princess room a carriage containing pierre who had been sent for 
and anna mikh ylovna who found it necessary to accompany him was
driving into the court of count bez khov s house as the wheels
rolled softly over the straw beneath the windows anna mikh ylovna 
having turned with words of comfort to her companion realized that
he was asleep in his corner and woke him up rousing himself pierre
followed anna mikh ylovna out of the carriage and only then began
to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him he
noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back
door while he was getting down from the carriage steps two men who
looked like tradespeople ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the
shadow of the wall pausing for a moment pierre noticed several other
men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides 
but neither anna mikh ylovna nor the footman nor the coachman who
could not help seeing these people took any notice of them it seems
to be all right pierre concluded and followed anna mikh ylovna 
she hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase calling to
pierre who was lagging behind to follow though he did not see why it
was necessary for him to go to the count at all still less why he had
to go by the back stairs yet judging by anna mikh ylovna s air
of assurance and haste pierre concluded that it was all absolutely
necessary halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by
some men who carrying pails came running downstairs their boots
clattering these men pressed close to the wall to let pierre and anna
mikh ylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them
there 

 is this the way to the princesses apartments asked anna
mikh ylovna of one of them 

 yes replied a footman in a bold loud voice as if anything were
now permissible the door to the left ma am 

 perhaps the count did not ask for me said pierre when he reached
the landing i d better go to my own room 

anna mikh ylovna paused and waited for him to come up 

 ah my friend she said touching his arm as she had done her
son s when speaking to him that afternoon believe me i suffer no
less than you do but be a man 

 but really hadn t i better go away he asked looking kindly at
her over his spectacles 

 ah my dear friend forget the wrongs that may have been done you 
think that he is your father perhaps in the agony of death she
sighed i have loved you like a son from the first trust yourself to
me pierre i shall not forget your interests 

pierre did not understand a word but the conviction that all this had
to be grew stronger and he meekly followed anna mikh ylovna who was
already opening a door 

this door led into a back anteroom an old man a servant of the
princesses sat in a corner knitting a stocking pierre had never been
in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of
these rooms anna mikh ylovna addressing a maid who was hurrying past
with a decanter on a tray as my dear and my sweet asked
about the princess health and then led pierre along a stone passage 
the first door on the left led into the princesses apartments the
maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door everything
in the house was done in haste at that time and pierre and anna
mikh ylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room where
prince vas li and the eldest princess were sitting close together
talking seeing them pass prince vas li drew back with obvious
impatience while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of
desperation slammed the door with all her might 

this action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on
prince vas li s face so out of keeping with his dignity that pierre
stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide anna
mikh ylovna evinced no surprise she only smiled faintly and sighed as
if to say that this was no more than she had expected 

 be a man my friend i will look after your interests said she in
reply to his look and went still faster along the passage 

pierre could not make out what it was all about and still less what
 watching over his interests meant but he decided that all these
things had to be from the passage they went into a large dimly
lit room adjoining the count s reception room it was one of those
sumptuous but cold apartments known to pierre only from the front
approach but even in this room there now stood an empty bath and water
had been spilled on the carpet they were met by a deacon with a censer
and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them they
went into the reception room familiar to pierre with two italian
windows opening into the conservatory with its large bust and full
length portrait of catherine the great the same people were still
sitting here in almost the same positions as before whispering to one
another all became silent and turned to look at the pale tear worn anna
mikh ylovna as she entered and at the big stout figure of pierre who 
hanging his head meekly followed her 

anna mikh ylovna s face expressed a consciousness that the decisive
moment had arrived with the air of a practical petersburg lady she now 
keeping pierre close beside her entered the room even more boldly than
that afternoon she felt that as she brought with her the person the
dying man wished to see her own admission was assured casting a rapid
glance at all those in the room and noticing the count s confessor
there she glided up to him with a sort of amble not exactly bowing yet
seeming to grow suddenly smaller and respectfully received the blessing
first of one and then of another priest 

 god be thanked that you are in time said she to one of the
priests all we relatives have been in such anxiety this young
man is the count s son she added more softly what a terrible
moment 

having said this she went up to the doctor 

 dear doctor said she this young man is the count s son is
there any hope 

the doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his
shoulders anna mikh ylovna with just the same movement raised her
shoulders and eyes almost closing the latter sighed and moved away
from the doctor to pierre to him in a particularly respectful and
tenderly sad voice she said 

 trust in his mercy and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit
and wait for her she went silently toward the door that everyone was
watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it 

pierre having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly moved
toward the sofa she had indicated as soon as anna mikh ylovna had
disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him
with something more than curiosity and sympathy he noticed that they
whispered to one another casting significant looks at him with a kind
of awe and even servility a deference such as he had never before
received was shown him a strange lady the one who had been talking to
the priests rose and offered him her seat an aide de camp picked up
and returned a glove pierre had dropped the doctors became respectfully
silent as he passed by and moved to make way for him at first pierre
wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady and also to
pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not
even in his way but all at once he felt that this would not do and
that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful
rite which everyone expected of him and that he was therefore bound
to accept their services he took the glove in silence from the
aide de camp and sat down in the lady s chair placing his huge hands
symmetrically on his knees in the na ve attitude of an egyptian statue 
and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be and that in
order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his
own ideas tonight but must yield himself up entirely to the will of
those who were guiding him 

not two minutes had passed before prince vas li with head erect
majestically entered the room he was wearing his long coat with three
stars on his breast he seemed to have grown thinner since the morning 
his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed
pierre he went up to him took his hand a thing he never used to do 
and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly
fixed on 

 courage courage my friend he has asked to see you that is
well and he turned to go 

but pierre thought it necessary to ask how is and hesitated 
not knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man the
count yet ashamed to call him father 

 he had another stroke about half an hour ago courage my
friend 

pierre s mind was in such a confused state that the word stroke 
suggested to him a blow from something he looked at prince vas li
in perplexity and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of
illness prince vas li said something to lorrain in passing and went
through the door on tiptoe he could not walk well on tiptoe and his
whole body jerked at each step the eldest princess followed him and
the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door 
through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about and
at last anna mikh ylovna still with the same expression pale but
resolute in the discharge of duty ran out and touching pierre lightly
on the arm said 

 the divine mercy is inexhaustible unction is about to be
administered come 

pierre went in at the door stepping on the soft carpet and noticed
that the strange lady the aide de camp and some of the servants all
followed him in as if there were now no further need for permission to
enter that room 





chapter xxiii

pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch its
walls hung round with persian carpets the part of the room behind the
columns with a high silk curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and
on the other an immense case containing icons was brightly illuminated
with red light like a russian church during evening service under
the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair and in that chair
on snowy white smooth pillows evidently freshly changed pierre
saw covered to the waist by a bright green quilt the familiar 
majestic figure of his father count bez khov with that gray mane of
hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion and the deep
characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome ruddy face he lay
just under the icons his large thick hands outside the quilt into the
right hand which was lying palm downwards a wax taper had been thrust
between forefinger and thumb and an old servant bending over from
behind the chair held it in position by the chair stood the priests 
their long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestments 
with lighted tapers in their hands slowly and solemnly conducting the
service a little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding
handkerchiefs to their eyes and just in front of them their eldest
sister catiche with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on
the icons as though declaring to all that she could not answer for
herself should she glance round anna mikh ylovna with a meek 
sorrowful and all forgiving expression on her face stood by the door
near the strange lady prince vas li in front of the door near the
invalid chair a wax taper in his left hand was leaning his left arm on
the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose 
and was crossing himself with his right hand turning his eyes upward
each time he touched his forehead his face wore a calm look of piety
and resignation to the will of god if you do not understand these
sentiments he seemed to be saying so much the worse for you 

behind him stood the aide de camp the doctors and the menservants 
the men and women had separated as in church all were silently crossing
themselves and the reading of the church service the subdued chanting
of deep bass voices and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of
feet were the only sounds that could be heard anna mikh ylovna with
an air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she
was about went across the room to where pierre was standing and gave
him a taper he lit it and distracted by observing those around him 
began crossing himself with the hand that held the taper 

sophie the rosy laughter loving youngest princess with the mole 
watched him she smiled hid her face in her handkerchief and remained
with it hidden for awhile then looking up and seeing pierre she
again began to laugh she evidently felt unable to look at him
without laughing but could not resist looking at him so to be out of
temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns in the midst
of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased they whispered
to one another and the old servant who was holding the count s hand
got up and said something to the ladies anna mikh ylovna stepped
forward and stooping over the dying man beckoned to lorrain from
behind her back the french doctor held no taper he was leaning
against one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he 
a foreigner in spite of all differences of faith understood the full
importance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it he
now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor
of life with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the
hand that was free and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected
a moment the sick man was given something to drink there was a
stir around him then the people resumed their places and the service
continued during this interval pierre noticed that prince vas li
left the chair on which he had been leaning and with an air
which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not
understand him it was so much the worse for them did not go up to the
dying man but passed by him joined the eldest princess and moved
with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its
silken hangings on leaving the bed both prince vas li and the princess
passed out by a back door but returned to their places one after the
other before the service was concluded pierre paid no more attention
to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on having made up his
mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was
in some way essential 

the chanting of the service ceased and the voice of the priest was
heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the
sacrament the dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before around
him everyone began to stir steps were audible and whispers among which
anna mikh ylovna s was the most distinct 

pierre heard her say 

 certainly he must be moved onto the bed here it will be
impossible 

the sick man was so surrounded by doctors princesses and servants
that pierre could no longer see the reddish yellow face with its gray
mane which though he saw other faces as well he had not lost sight
of for a single moment during the whole service he judged by the
cautious movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that
they had lifted the dying man and were moving him 

 catch hold of my arm or you ll drop him he heard one of the
servants say in a frightened whisper catch hold from underneath 
here exclaimed different voices and the heavy breathing of the
bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried as if the
weight they were carrying were too much for them 

as the bearers among whom was anna mikh ylovna passed the young man
he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying
man s high stout uncovered chest and powerful shoulders raised by
those who were holding him under the armpits and of his gray curly 
leonine head this head with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones 
its handsome sensual mouth and its cold majestic expression was
not disfigured by the approach of death it was the same as pierre
remembered it three months before when the count had sent him to
petersburg but now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven
movements of the bearers and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon
nothing 

after a few minutes bustle beside the high bedstead those who had
carried the sick man dispersed anna mikh ylovna touched pierre s
hand and said come pierre went with her to the bed on which the
sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony
just completed he lay with his head propped high on the pillows his
hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt the palms
downward when pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him but
with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal
man either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes
they must look somewhere or it meant too much pierre hesitated 
not knowing what to do and glanced inquiringly at his guide anna
mikh ylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes glancing at the sick
man s hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss pierre 
carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt followed her
suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned fleshy hand neither
the hand nor a single muscle of the count s face stirred once more
pierre looked questioningly at anna mikh ylovna to see what he was to
do next anna mikh ylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood
beside the bed pierre obediently sat down his eyes asking if he were
doing right anna mikh ylovna nodded approvingly again pierre fell
into the na vely symmetrical pose of an egyptian statue evidently
distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing
his utmost to look as small as possible he looked at the count who
still gazed at the spot where pierre s face had been before he sat
down anna mikh ylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of
the pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the
father and son this lasted about two minutes which to pierre seemed an
hour suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count s face began
to twitch the twitching increased the handsome mouth was drawn to one
side only now did pierre realize how near death his father was and
from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct hoarse sound anna
mikh ylovna looked attentively at the sick man s eyes trying to
guess what he wanted she pointed first to pierre then to some drink 
then named prince vas li in an inquiring whisper then pointed to the
quilt the eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience he made an
effort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the
bed 

 wants to turn on the other side whispered the servant and got up
to turn the count s heavy body toward the wall 

pierre rose to help him 

while the count was being turned over one of his arms fell back
helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward whether he
noticed the look of terror with which pierre regarded that lifeless arm 
or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain at any
rate he glanced at the refractory arm at pierre s terror stricken
face and again at the arm and on his face a feeble piteous smile
appeared quite out of keeping with his features that seemed to deride
his own helplessness at sight of this smile pierre felt an unexpected
quivering in his breast and a tickling in his nose and tears dimmed his
eyes the sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall 
he sighed 

 he is dozing said anna mikh ylovna observing that one of the
princesses was coming to take her turn at watching let us go 

pierre went out 





chapter xxiv

there was now no one in the reception room except prince vas li and the
eldest princess who were sitting under the portrait of catherine the
great and talking eagerly as soon as they saw pierre and his companion
they became silent and pierre thought he saw the princess hide
something as she whispered 

 i can t bear the sight of that woman 

 catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room said prince
vas li to anna mikh ylovna go and take something my poor anna
mikh ylovna or you will not hold out 

to pierre he said nothing merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze
below the shoulder pierre went with anna mikh ylovna into the small
drawing room 

 there is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup
of this delicious russian tea lorrain was saying with an air of
restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate chinese
handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid
in the small circular room around the table all who were at count
bez khov s house that night had gathered to fortify themselves 
pierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors
and little tables during balls given at the house pierre who did not
know how to dance had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies
who as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and
pearls on their bare shoulders looked at themselves in the brilliantly
lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times now
this same room was dimly lighted by two candles on one small table tea
things and supper dishes stood in disorder and in the middle of the
night a motley throng of people sat there not merrymaking but somberly
whispering and betraying by every word and movement that they none
of them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the
bedroom pierre did not eat anything though he would very much have
liked to he looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was
again going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left prince
vas li and the eldest princess pierre concluded that this also was
essential and after a short interval followed her anna mikh ylovna
was standing beside the princess and they were both speaking in excited
whispers 

 permit me princess to know what is necessary and what is not
necessary said the younger of the two speakers evidently in the
same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room 

 but my dear princess answered anna mikh ylovna blandly but
impressively blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other
from passing won t this be too much for poor uncle at a moment
when he needs repose worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is
already prepared 

prince vas li was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude 
with one leg crossed high above the other his cheeks which were so
flabby that they looked heavier below were twitching violently but
he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were
saying 

 come my dear anna mikh ylovna let catiche do as she pleases you
know how fond the count is of her 

 i don t even know what is in this paper said the younger of
the two ladies addressing prince vas li and pointing to an inlaid
portfolio she held in her hand all i know is that his real will is
in his writing table and this is a paper he has forgotten 

she tried to pass anna mikh ylovna but the latter sprang so as to bar
her path 

 i know my dear kind princess said anna mikh ylovna seizing
the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily 
 dear princess i beg and implore you have some pity on him je vous
en conjure 

the princess did not reply their efforts in the struggle for the
portfolio were the only sounds audible but it was evident that if
the princess did speak her words would not be flattering to anna
mikh ylovna though the latter held on tenaciously her voice lost none
of its honeyed firmness and softness 

 pierre my dear come here i think he will not be out of place in a
family consultation is it not so prince 

 why don t you speak cousin suddenly shrieked the princess so
loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled why
do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to
interfere making a scene on the very threshold of a dying man s room 
intriguer she hissed viciously and tugged with all her might at the
portfolio 

but anna mikh ylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the
portfolio and changed her grip 

prince vas li rose oh said he with reproach and surprise 
 this is absurd come let go i tell you 

the princess let go 

 and you too 

but anna mikh ylovna did not obey him 

 let go i tell you i will take the responsibility i myself will go
and ask him i does that satisfy you 

 but prince said anna mikh ylovna after such a solemn
sacrament allow him a moment s peace here pierre tell them your
opinion said she turning to the young man who having come quite
close was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the princess
which had lost all dignity and at the twitching cheeks of prince
vas li 

 remember that you will answer for the consequences said prince
vas li severely you don t know what you are doing 

 vile woman shouted the princess darting unexpectedly at anna
mikh ylovna and snatching the portfolio from her 

prince vas li bent his head and spread out his hands 

at this moment that terrible door which pierre had watched so long
and which had always opened so quietly burst noisily open and banged
against the wall and the second of the three sisters rushed out
wringing her hands 

 what are you doing she cried vehemently he is dying and you
leave me alone with him 

her sister dropped the portfolio anna mikh ylovna stooping quickly
caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom the eldest
princess and prince vas li recovering themselves followed her a few
minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face again
biting her underlip at sight of pierre her expression showed an
irrepressible hatred 

 yes now you may be glad said she this is what you have
been waiting for and bursting into tears she hid her face in her
handkerchief and rushed from the room 

prince vas li came next he staggered to the sofa on which pierre was
sitting and dropped onto it covering his face with his hand pierre
noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an
ague 

 ah my friend said he taking pierre by the elbow and there was
in his voice a sincerity and weakness pierre had never observed in it
before how often we sin how much we deceive and all for what i am
near sixty dear friend i too all will end in death all death is
awful and he burst into tears 

anna mikh ylovna came out last she approached pierre with slow quiet
steps 

 pierre she said 

pierre gave her an inquiring look she kissed the young man on his
forehead wetting him with her tears then after a pause she said 

 he is no more 

pierre looked at her over his spectacles 

 come i will go with you try to weep nothing gives such relief as
tears 

she led him into the dark drawing room and pierre was glad no one could
see his face anna mikh ylovna left him and when she returned he was
fast asleep with his head on his arm 

in the morning anna mikh ylovna said to pierre 

 yes my dear this is a great loss for us all not to speak of you 
but god will support you you are young and are now i hope in command
of an immense fortune the will has not yet been opened i know you
well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head but it imposes
duties on you and you must be a man 

pierre was silent 

 perhaps later on i may tell you my dear boy that if i had not been
there god only knows what would have happened you know uncle promised
me only the day before yesterday not to forget bor s but he had
no time i hope my dear friend you will carry out your father s
wish 

pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in
silence at princess anna mikh ylovna after her talk with pierre anna
mikh ylovna returned to the rost vs and went to bed on waking in
the morning she told the rost vs and all her acquaintances the details
of count bez khov s death she said the count had died as she would
herself wish to die that his end was not only touching but edifying as
to the last meeting between father and son it was so touching that she
could not think of it without tears and did not know which had behaved
better during those awful moments the father who so remembered
everything and everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to
the son or pierre whom it had been pitiful to see so stricken was he
with grief though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his
dying father it is painful but it does one good it uplifts the
soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son said she 
of the behavior of the eldest princess and prince vas li she spoke
disapprovingly but in whispers and as a great secret 





chapter xxv

at bald hills prince nicholas andr evich bolk nski s estate the
arrival of young prince andrew and his wife was daily expected but
this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old
prince s household general in chief prince nicholas andr evich
 nicknamed in society the king of prussia ever since the emperor
paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously
with his daughter princess mary and her companion mademoiselle
bourienne though in the new reign he was free to return to the
capitals he still continued to live in the country remarking that
anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from moscow to
bald hills while he himself needed no one and nothing he used to
say that there are only two sources of human vice idleness and
superstition and only two virtues activity and intelligence he
himself undertook his daughter s education and to develop these two
cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry
till she was twenty and arranged her life so that her whole time was
occupied he was himself always occupied writing his memoirs solving
problems in higher mathematics turning snuffboxes on a lathe working
in the garden or superintending the building that was always going on
at his estate as regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity 
regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of
exactitude he always came to table under precisely the same conditions 
and not only at the same hour but at the same minute with those about
him from his daughter to his serfs the prince was sharp and invariably
exacting so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear
and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused although he was
in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs every high
official appointed to the province in which the prince s estate lay
considered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber
just as the architect gardener or princess mary did till the prince
appeared punctually to the appointed hour everyone sitting in this
antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when
the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather
small old man with powdered wig small withered hands and bushy gray
eyebrows which when he frowned sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd 
youthfully glittering eyes 

on the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive princess
mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the
morning greeting crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a
silent prayer every morning she came in like that and every morning
prayed that the daily interview might pass off well 

an old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose
quietly and said in a whisper please walk in 

through the door came the regular hum of a lathe the princess timidly
opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily she paused at the
entrance the prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round
continued his work 

the enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use 
the large table covered with books and plans the tall glass fronted
bookcases with keys in the locks the high desk for writing while
standing up on which lay an open exercise book and the lathe with
tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered around all indicated
continuous varied and orderly activity the motion of the small foot
shod in a tartar boot embroidered with silver and the firm pressure
of the lean sinewy hand showed that the prince still possessed the
tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age after a few more turns
of the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal wiped his chisel 
dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe and approaching
the table summoned his daughter he never gave his children a blessing 
so he simply held out his bristly cheek as yet unshaven and regarding
her tenderly and attentively said severely 

 quite well all right then sit down he took the exercise book
containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair
with his foot 

 for tomorrow said he quickly finding the page and making a
scratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail 

the princess bent over the exercise book on the table 

 wait a bit here s a letter for you said the old man suddenly 
taking a letter addressed in a woman s hand from a bag hanging above
the table onto which he threw it 

at the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the
princess face she took it quickly and bent her head over it 

 from h lo se asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his
still sound yellowish teeth 

 yes it s from julie replied the princess with a timid glance
and a timid smile 

 i ll let two more letters pass but the third i ll read said
the prince sternly i m afraid you write much nonsense i ll read
the third 

 read this if you like father said the princess blushing still
more and holding out the letter 

 the third i said the third cried the prince abruptly pushing
the letter away and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him
the exercise book containing geometrical figures 

 well madam he began stooping over the book close to his
daughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat 
so that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of
old age and tobacco which she had known so long now madam these
triangles are equal please note that the angle abc 

the princess looked in a scared way at her father s eyes glittering
close to her the red patches on her face came and went and it was
plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her
fear would prevent her understanding any of her father s further
explanations however clear they might be whether it was the
teacher s fault or the pupil s this same thing happened every day 
the princess eyes grew dim she could not see and could not hear
anything but was only conscious of her stern father s withered face
close to her of his breath and the smell of him and could think only
of how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem in
peace the old man was beside himself moved the chair on which he was
sitting noisily backward and forward made efforts to control himself
and not become vehement but almost always did become vehement scolded 
and sometimes flung the exercise book away 

the princess gave a wrong answer 

 well now isn t she a fool shouted the prince pushing the book
aside and turning sharply away but rising immediately he paced up and
down lightly touched his daughter s hair and sat down again 

he drew up his chair and continued to explain 

 this won t do princess it won t do said he when princess
mary having taken and closed the exercise book with the next day s
lesson was about to leave mathematics are most important madam 
i don t want to have you like our silly ladies get used to it and
you ll like it and he patted her cheek it will drive all the
nonsense out of your head 

she turned to go but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut
book from the high desk 

 here is some sort of key to the mysteries that your h lo se has
sent you religious i don t interfere with anyone s belief i
have looked at it take it well now go go 

he patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her 

princess mary went back to her room with the sad scared expression that
rarely left her and which made her plain sickly face yet plainer she
sat down at her writing table on which stood miniature portraits and
which was littered with books and papers the princess was as untidy as
her father was tidy she put down the geometry book and eagerly broke
the seal of her letter it was from her most intimate friend from
childhood that same julie kar gina who had been at the rost vs 
name day party 

julie wrote in french 

dear and precious friend how terrible and frightful a thing is
separation though i tell myself that half my life and half my happiness
are wrapped up in you and that in spite of the distance separating us
our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds my heart rebels against
fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me i cannot
overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever since
we parted why are we not together as we were last summer in your big
study on the blue sofa the confidential sofa why cannot i now as
three months ago draw fresh moral strength from your look so gentle 
calm and penetrating a look i loved so well and seem to see before me
as i write 

having read thus far princess mary sighed and glanced into the mirror
which stood on her right it reflected a weak ungraceful figure and
thin face her eyes always sad now looked with particular hopelessness
at her reflection in the glass she flatters me thought the
princess turning away and continuing to read but julie did not flatter
her friend the princess eyes large deep and luminous it seemed
as if at times there radiated from them shafts of warm light were
so beautiful that very often in spite of the plainness of her face
they gave her an attraction more powerful than that of beauty but the
princess never saw the beautiful expression of her own eyes the look
they had when she was not thinking of herself as with everyone her
face assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a
glass she went on reading 

all moscow talks of nothing but war one of my two brothers is already
abroad the other is with the guards who are starting on their march
to the frontier our dear emperor has left petersburg and it is thought
intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war god grant
that the corsican monster who is destroying the peace of europe may
be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the almighty in his
goodness to give us as sovereign to say nothing of my brothers this
war has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart i mean
young nicholas rost v who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain
inactive and has left the university to join the army i will confess to
you dear mary that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for
the army was a great grief to me this young man of whom i spoke to you
last summer is so noble minded and full of that real youthfulness which
one seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and particularly 
he is so frank and has so much heart he is so pure and poetic that
my relations with him transient as they were have been one of the
sweetest comforts to my poor heart which has already suffered so much 
someday i will tell you about our parting and all that was said then 
that is still too fresh ah dear friend you are happy not to know
these poignant joys and sorrows you are fortunate for the latter are
generally the stronger i know very well that count nicholas is too
young ever to be more to me than a friend but this sweet friendship 
this poetic and pure intimacy were what my heart needed but enough of
this the chief news about which all moscow gossips is the death of
old count bez khov and his inheritance fancy the three princesses
have received very little prince vas li nothing and it is monsieur
pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been
recognized as legitimate so that he is now count bez khov and
possessor of the finest fortune in russia it is rumored that prince
vas li played a very despicable part in this affair and that he
returned to petersburg quite crestfallen 

i confess i understand very little about all these matters of wills and
inheritance but i do know that since this young man whom we all used
to know as plain monsieur pierre has become count bez khov and the
owner of one of the largest fortunes in russia i am much amused to
watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by
marriageable daughters and of the young ladies themselves toward
him though between you and me he always seemed to me a poor sort
of fellow as for the past two years people have amused themselves
by finding husbands for me most of whom i don t even know the
matchmaking chronicles of moscow now speak of me as the future countess
bez khova but you will understand that i have no desire for the post 
 propos of marriages do you know that a while ago that universal
auntie anna mikh ylovna told me under the seal of strict secrecy of
a plan of marriage for you it is neither more nor less than with prince
vas li s son anatole whom they wish to reform by marrying him to
someone rich and distingu e and it is on you that his relations 
choice has fallen i don t know what you will think of it but
i consider it my duty to let you know of it he is said to be very
handsome and a terrible scapegrace that is all i have been able to find
out about him 

but enough of gossip i am at the end of my second sheet of paper and
mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the apr ksins read the
mystical book i am sending you it has an enormous success here though
there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp it
is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul adieu give
my respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to mademoiselle
bourienne i embrace you as i love you 

julie

p s let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife 

the princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous
eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed then she suddenly
rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table she took a sheet of
paper and her hand moved rapidly over it this is the reply she wrote 
also in french 

dear and precious friend your letter of the 13th has given me great
delight so you still love me my romantic julie separation of which
you say so much that is bad does not seem to have had its usual effect
on you you complain of our separation what then should i say if i
dared complain i who am deprived of all who are dear to me ah if
we had not religion to console us life would be very sad why do you
suppose that i should look severely on your affection for that young
man on such matters i am only severe with myself i understand such
feelings in others and if never having felt them i cannot approve of
them neither do i condemn them only it seems to me that christian
love love of one s neighbor love of one s enemy is worthier 
sweeter and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a
young man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself 

the news of count bez khov s death reached us before your letter
and my father was much affected by it he says the count was the last
representative but one of the great century and that it is his own
turn now but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as
possible god preserve us from that terrible misfortune 

i cannot agree with you about pierre whom i knew as a child he always
seemed to me to have an excellent heart and that is the quality i value
most in people as to his inheritance and the part played by prince
vas li it is very sad for both ah my dear friend our divine
saviour s words that it is easier for a camel to go through the
eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god are
terribly true i pity prince vas li but am still more sorry for pierre 
so young and burdened with such riches to what temptations he will be
exposed if i were asked what i desire most on earth it would be to be
poorer than the poorest beggar a thousand thanks dear friend for the
volume you have sent me and which has such success in moscow yet since
you tell me that among some good things it contains others which our
weak human understanding cannot grasp it seems to me rather useless to
spend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear
no fruit i never could understand the fondness some people have for
confusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken
their doubts and excite their imagination giving them a bent for
exaggeration quite contrary to christian simplicity let us rather read
the epistles and gospels let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries
they contain for how can we miserable sinners that we are know the
terrible and holy secrets of providence while we remain in this flesh
which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the eternal let us
rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our
divine saviour has left for our guidance here below let us try to
conform to them and follow them and let us be persuaded that the less
we let our feeble human minds roam the better we shall please god who
rejects all knowledge that does not come from him and the less we seek
to fathom what he has been pleased to conceal from us the sooner will
he vouchsafe its revelation to us through his divine spirit 

my father has not spoken to me of a suitor but has only told me that he
has received a letter and is expecting a visit from prince vas li in
regard to this project of marriage for me i will tell you dear sweet
friend that i look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must
conform however painful it may be to me should the almighty lay
the duties of wife and mother upon me i shall try to perform them as
faithfully as i can without disquieting myself by examining my feelings
toward him whom he may give me for husband 

i have had a letter from my brother who announces his speedy arrival
at bald hills with his wife this pleasure will be but a brief one 
however for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war
into which we have been drawn god knows how or why not only where you
are at the heart of affairs and of the world is the talk all of
war even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature which townsfolk
consider characteristic of the country rumors of war are heard
and painfully felt my father talks of nothing but marches and
countermarches things of which i understand nothing and the day
before yesterday during my daily walk through the village i witnessed a
heartrending scene it was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our
people and starting to join the army you should have seen the state of
the mothers wives and children of the men who were going and should
have heard the sobs it seems as though mankind has forgotten the
laws of its divine saviour who preached love and forgiveness of
injuries and that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing
one another 

adieu dear and kind friend may our divine saviour and his most holy
mother keep you in their holy and all powerful care 

mary

 ah you are sending off a letter princess i have already dispatched
mine i have written to my poor mother said the smiling mademoiselle
bourienne rapidly in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural r s 
she brought into princess mary s strenuous mournful and gloomy
world a quite different atmosphere careless lighthearted and
self satisfied 

 princess i must warn you she added lowering her voice and
evidently listening to herself with pleasure and speaking with
exaggerated grasseyement the prince has been scolding michael
iv novich he is in a very bad humor very morose be prepared 

 ah dear friend replied princess mary i have asked you never
to warn me of the humor my father is in i do not allow myself to judge
him and would not have others do so 

the princess glanced at her watch and seeing that she was five minutes
late in starting her practice on the clavichord went into the sitting
room with a look of alarm between twelve and two o clock as the
day was mapped out the prince rested and the princess played the
clavichord 





chapter xxvi

the gray haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of
the prince who was in his large study from the far side of the house
through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages twenty
times repeated of a sonata by dussek 

just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the
porch prince andrew got out of the carriage helped his little wife to
alight and let her pass into the house before him old t khon wearing
a wig put his head out of the door of the antechamber reported in
a whisper that the prince was sleeping and hastily closed the door 
t khon knew that neither the son s arrival nor any other unusual
event must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day prince
andrew apparently knew this as well as t khon he looked at his watch
as if to ascertain whether his father s habits had changed since he
was at home last and having assured himself that they had not he
turned to his wife 

 he will get up in twenty minutes let us go across to mary s
room he said 

the little princess had grown stouter during this time but her eyes
and her short downy smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as
merrily and prettily as ever 

 why this is a palace she said to her husband looking around
with the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball 
 let s come quick quick and with a glance round she smiled at
t khon at her husband and at the footman who accompanied them 

 is that mary practicing let s go quietly and take her by
surprise 

prince andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression 

 you ve grown older t khon he said in passing to the old man 
who kissed his hand 

before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord
came the pretty fair haired frenchwoman mademoiselle bourienne 
rushed out apparently beside herself with delight 

 ah what joy for the princess exclaimed she at last i must
let her know 

 no no please not you are mademoiselle bourienne said
the little princess kissing her i know you already through my
sister in law s friendship for you she was not expecting us 

they went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound
of the oft repeated passage of the sonata prince andrew stopped and
made a grimace as if expecting something unpleasant 

the little princess entered the room the passage broke off in the
middle a cry was heard then princess mary s heavy tread and the
sound of kissing when prince andrew went in the two princesses who
had only met once before for a short time at his wedding were in
each other s arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they
happened to touch mademoiselle bourienne stood near them pressing her
hand to her heart with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to
cry or to laugh prince andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned as
lovers of music do when they hear a false note the two women let go
of one another and then as if afraid of being too late seized each
other s hands kissing them and pulling them away and again began
kissing each other on the face and then to prince andrew s surprise
both began to cry and kissed again mademoiselle bourienne also began to
cry prince andrew evidently felt ill at ease but to the two women
it seemed quite natural that they should cry and apparently it never
entered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting 

 ah my dear ah mary they suddenly exclaimed and then
laughed i dreamed last night you were not expecting
us ah mary you have got thinner and you have grown
stouter 

 i knew the princess at once put in mademoiselle bourienne 

 and i had no idea exclaimed princess mary ah andrew i
did not see you 

prince andrew and his sister hand in hand kissed one another and
he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever princess mary had
turned toward her brother and through her tears the loving warm 
gentle look of her large luminous eyes very beautiful at that moment 
rested on prince andrew s face 

the little princess talked incessantly her short downy upper lip
continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary
and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of
glittering teeth and sparkling eyes she told of an accident they had
had on the sp sski hill which might have been serious for her in her
condition and immediately after that informed them that she had left
all her clothes in petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have
to dress in here and that andrew had quite changed and that kitty
od ntsova had married an old man and that there was a suitor for mary 
a real one but that they would talk of that later princess mary was
still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full
of love and sadness it was plain that she was following a train of
thought independent of her sister in law s words in the midst of a
description of the last petersburg fete she addressed her brother 

 so you are really going to the war andrew she said sighing 

lise sighed too 

 yes and even tomorrow replied her brother 

 he is leaving me here god knows why when he might have had
promotion 

princess mary did not listen to the end but continuing her train of
thought turned to her sister in law with a tender glance at her figure 

 is it certain she said 

the face of the little princess changed she sighed and said yes 
quite certain ah it is very dreadful 

her lip descended she brought her face close to her sister in law s
and unexpectedly again began to cry 

 she needs rest said prince andrew with a frown don t you 
lise take her to your room and i ll go to father how is he just the
same 

 yes just the same though i don t know what your opinion will
be answered the princess joyfully 

 and are the hours the same and the walks in the avenues and the
lathe asked prince andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which
showed that in spite of all his love and respect for his father he was
aware of his weaknesses 

 the hours are the same and the lathe and also the mathematics and
my geometry lessons said princess mary gleefully as if her lessons
in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life 

when the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old
prince to get up t khon came to call the young prince to his father 
the old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his
son s arrival he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while
he dressed for dinner the old prince always dressed in old fashioned
style wearing an antique coat and powdered hair and when prince andrew
entered his father s dressing room not with the contemptuous look and
manner he wore in drawing rooms but with the animated face with which
he talked to pierre the old man was sitting on a large leather covered
chair wrapped in a powdering mantle entrusting his head to t khon 

 ah here s the warrior wants to vanquish buonaparte said the
old man shaking his powdered head as much as the tail which t khon
was holding fast to plait would allow 

 you at least must tackle him properly or else if he goes on like
this he ll soon have us too for his subjects how are you and he
held out his cheek 

the old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner he
used to say that a nap after dinner was silver before dinner 
golden he cast happy sidelong glances at his son from under his
thick bushy eyebrows prince andrew went up and kissed his father on
the spot indicated to him he made no reply on his father s favorite
topic making fun of the military men of the day and more particularly
of bonaparte 

 yes father i have come to you and brought my wife who is
pregnant said prince andrew following every movement of his
father s face with an eager and respectful look how is your
health 

 only fools and rakes fall ill my boy you know me i am busy from
morning till night and abstemious so of course i am well 

 thank god said his son smiling 

 god has nothing to do with it well go on he continued 
returning to his hobby tell me how the germans have taught you to
fight bonaparte by this new science you call strategy 

prince andrew smiled 

 give me time to collect my wits father said he with a smile
that showed that his father s foibles did not prevent his son from
loving and honoring him why i have not yet had time to settle
down 

 nonsense nonsense cried the old man shaking his pigtail to
see whether it was firmly plaited and grasping his by the hand the
house for your wife is ready princess mary will take her there and
show her over and they ll talk nineteen to the dozen that s
their woman s way i am glad to have her sit down and talk about
mikhelson s army i understand tolst y s too a simultaneous
expedition but what s the southern army to do prussia is
neutral i know that what about austria said he rising from his
chair and pacing up and down the room followed by t khon who ran after
him handing him different articles of clothing what of sweden how
will they cross pomerania 

prince andrew seeing that his father insisted began at first
reluctantly but gradually with more and more animation and from habit
changing unconsciously from russian to french as he went on to explain
the plan of operation for the coming campaign he explained how an army 
ninety thousand strong was to threaten prussia so as to bring her out
of her neutrality and draw her into the war how part of that army was
to join some swedish forces at stralsund how two hundred and twenty
thousand austrians with a hundred thousand russians were to operate in
italy and on the rhine how fifty thousand russians and as many english
were to land at naples and how a total force of five hundred thousand
men was to attack the french from different sides the old prince did
not evince the least interest during this explanation but as if he were
not listening to it continued to dress while walking about and three
times unexpectedly interrupted once he stopped it by shouting the
white one the white one 

this meant that t khon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted 
another time he interrupted saying 

 and will she soon be confined and shaking his head reproachfully
said that s bad go on go on 

the third interruption came when prince andrew was finishing his
description the old man began to sing in the cracked voice of old age 
 malbrook s en va t en guerre dieu sait quand reviendra 

 marlborough is going to the wars god knows when he ll
 return 


his son only smiled 

 i don t say it s a plan i approve of said the son i am
only telling you what it is napoleon has also formed his plan by now 
not worse than this one 

 well you ve told me nothing new and the old man repeated 
meditatively and rapidly 

 dieu sait quand reviendra go to the dining room 





chapter xxvii

at the appointed hour the prince powdered and shaven entered the
dining room where his daughter in law princess mary and mademoiselle
bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect who by
a strange caprice of his employer s was admitted to table though the
position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly
not have caused him to expect that honor the prince who generally kept
very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important
government officials to his table had unexpectedly selected michael
iv novich who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his
checked handkerchief to illustrate the theory that all men are equals 
and had more than once impressed on his daughter that michael iv novich
was not a whit worse than you or i at dinner the prince usually
spoke to the taciturn michael iv novich more often than to anyone else 

in the dining room which like all the rooms in the house was
exceedingly lofty the members of the household and the footmen one
behind each chair stood waiting for the prince to enter the head
butler napkin on arm was scanning the setting of the table making
signs to the footmen and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door
by which the prince was to enter prince andrew was looking at a large
gilt frame new to him containing the genealogical tree of the princes
bolk nski opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted
portrait evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate 
of a ruling prince in a crown an alleged descendant of r rik and
ancestor of the bolk nskis prince andrew looking again at that
genealogical tree shook his head laughing as a man laughs who looks at
a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing 

 how thoroughly like him that is he said to princess mary who had
come up to him 

princess mary looked at her brother in surprise she did not understand
what he was laughing at everything her father did inspired her with
reverence and was beyond question 

 everyone has his achilles heel continued prince andrew 
 fancy with his powerful mind indulging in such nonsense 

princess mary could not understand the boldness of her brother s
criticism and was about to reply when the expected footsteps were heard
coming from the study the prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was
his wont as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners
with the strict formality of his house at that moment the great clock
struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing
room the prince stood still his lively glittering eyes from under
their thick bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on
the little princess she felt as courtiers do when the tsar enters the
sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around
him he stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of
her neck 

 i m glad glad to see you he said looking attentively into
her eyes and then quickly went to his place and sat down sit down 
sit down sit down michael iv novich 

he indicated a place beside him to his daughter in law a footman moved
the chair for her 

 ho ho said the old man casting his eyes on her rounded figure 
 you ve been in a hurry that s bad 

he laughed in his usual dry cold unpleasant way with his lips only
and not with his eyes 

 you must walk walk as much as possible as much as possible he
said 

the little princess did not or did not wish to hear his words she was
silent and seemed confused the prince asked her about her father and
she began to smile and talk he asked about mutual acquaintances and
she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings
from various people and retelling the town gossip 

 countess apr ksina poor thing has lost her husband and she has
cried her eyes out she said growing more and more lively 

as she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly 
and suddenly as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a
definite idea of her he turned away and addressed michael iv novich 

 well michael iv novich our bonaparte will be having a bad time
of it prince andrew he always spoke thus of his son has been
telling me what forces are being collected against him while you and i
never thought much of him 

michael iv novich did not at all know when you and i had said
such things about bonaparte but understanding that he was wanted as
a peg on which to hang the prince s favorite topic he looked
inquiringly at the young prince wondering what would follow 

 he is a great tactician said the prince to his son pointing to
the architect 

and the conversation again turned on the war on bonaparte and the
generals and statesmen of the day the old prince seemed convinced not
only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the
a b c of war or of politics and that bonaparte was an insignificant
little frenchy successful only because there were no longer any
pot mkins or suv rovs left to oppose him but he was also convinced
that there were no political difficulties in europe and no real war 
but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing 
pretending to do something real prince andrew gaily bore with his
father s ridicule of the new men and drew him on and listened to him
with evident pleasure 

 the past always seems good said he but did not suv rov
himself fall into a trap moreau set him and from which he did not know
how to escape 

 who told you that who cried the prince suv rov and he
jerked away his plate which t khon briskly caught suv rov 
consider prince andrew two frederick and suv rov moreau 
moreau would have been a prisoner if suv rov had had a free hand but
he had the hofs kriegs wurst schnapps rath on his hands it would have
puzzled the devil himself when you get there you ll find out what
those hofs kriegs wurst raths are suv rov couldn t manage them so
what chance has michael kut zov no my dear boy he continued 
 you and your generals won t get on against buonaparte you ll
have to call in the french so that birds of a feather may fight
together the german pahlen has been sent to new york in america to
fetch the frenchman moreau he said alluding to the invitation made
that year to moreau to enter the russian service wonderful 
were the pot mkins suv rovs and orl vs germans no lad either you
fellows have all lost your wits or i have outlived mine may god help
you but we ll see what will happen buonaparte has become a great
commander among them hm 

 i don t at all say that all the plans are good said prince
andrew i am only surprised at your opinion of bonaparte you
may laugh as much as you like but all the same bonaparte is a great
general 

 michael iv novich cried the old prince to the architect who 
busy with his roast meat hoped he had been forgotten didn t
i tell you buonaparte was a great tactician here he says the same
thing 

 to be sure your excellency replied the architect 

the prince again laughed his frigid laugh 

 buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth he has got
splendid soldiers besides he began by attacking germans and only
idlers have failed to beat the germans since the world began everybody
has beaten the germans they beat no one except one another he made
his reputation fighting them 

and the prince began explaining all the blunders which according to
him bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics his
son made no rejoinder but it was evident that whatever arguments were
presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion he
listened refraining from a reply and involuntarily wondered how this
old man living alone in the country for so many years could know and
discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent european military and
political events 

 you think i m an old man and don t understand the present state
of affairs concluded his father but it troubles me i don t
sleep at night come now where has this great commander of yours shown
his skill he concluded 

 that would take too long to tell answered the son 

 well then go off to your buonaparte mademoiselle bourienne 
here s another admirer of that powder monkey emperor of yours he
exclaimed in excellent french 

 you know prince i am not a bonapartist 

 dieu sait quand reviendra hummed the prince out of tune and with
a laugh still more so he quitted the table 

the little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of
the dinner sat silent glancing with a frightened look now at her
father in law and now at princess mary when they left the table she
took her sister in law s arm and drew her into another room 

 what a clever man your father is said she perhaps that is why
i am afraid of him 

 oh he is so kind answered princess mary 





chapter xxviii

prince andrew was to leave next evening the old prince not altering
his routine retired as usual after dinner the little princess was in
her sister in law s room prince andrew in a traveling coat without
epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him 
after inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in he
ordered the horses to be harnessed only those things he always kept
with him remained in his room a small box a large canteen fitted
with silver plate two turkish pistols and a saber a present from
his father who had brought it from the siege of och kov all these
traveling effects of prince andrew s were in very good order new 
clean and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes 

when starting on a journey or changing their mode of life men capable
of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind at such moments
one reviews the past and plans for the future prince andrew s face
looked very thoughtful and tender with his hands behind him he paced
briskly from corner to corner of the room looking straight before him
and thoughtfully shaking his head did he fear going to the war or was
he sad at leaving his wife perhaps both but evidently he did not
wish to be seen in that mood for hearing footsteps in the passage he
hurriedly unclasped his hands stopped at a table as if tying the
cover of the small box and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable
expression it was the heavy tread of princess mary that he heard 

 i hear you have given orders to harness she cried panting she
had apparently been running and i did so wish to have another talk
with you alone god knows how long we may again be parted you are not
angry with me for coming you have changed so andr sha she added 
as if to explain such a question 

she smiled as she uttered his pet name andr sha it was
obviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be
andr sha the slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in
childhood 

 and where is lise he asked answering her question only by a
smile 

 she was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room 
oh andrew what a treasure of a wife you have said she sitting
down on the sofa facing her brother she is quite a child such a
dear merry child i have grown so fond of her 

prince andrew was silent but the princess noticed the ironical and
contemptuous look that showed itself on his face 

 one must be indulgent to little weaknesses who is free from them 
andrew don t forget that she has grown up and been educated in
society and so her position now is not a rosy one we should enter into
everyone s situation tout comprendre c est tout pardonner think
what it must be for her poor thing after what she has been used to 
to be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country in her
condition it s very hard 

 to understand all is to forgive all 

prince andrew smiled as he looked at his sister as we smile at those we
think we thoroughly understand 

 you live in the country and don t think the life terrible he
replied 

 i that s different why speak of me i don t want any other
life and can t for i know no other but think andrew for a young
society woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her
life all alone for papa is always busy and i well you know what
poor resources i have for entertaining a woman used to the best society 
there is only mademoiselle bourienne 

 i don t like your mademoiselle bourienne at all said prince
andrew 

 no she is very nice and kind and above all she s much to be
pitied she has no one no one to tell the truth i don t need her 
and she s even in my way you know i always was a savage and now am
even more so i like being alone father likes her very much she and
michael iv novich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and
kind because he has been a benefactor to them both as sterne says 
 we don t love people so much for the good they have done us as
for the good we have done them father took her when she was homeless
after losing her own father she is very good natured and my father
likes her way of reading she reads to him in the evenings and reads
splendidly 

 to be quite frank mary i expect father s character sometimes
makes things trying for you doesn t it prince andrew asked
suddenly 

princess mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question 

 for me for me trying for me said she 

 he always was rather harsh and now i should think he s getting
very trying said prince andrew apparently speaking lightly of their
father in order to puzzle or test his sister 

 you are good in every way andrew but you have a kind of
intellectual pride said the princess following the train of her own
thoughts rather than the trend of the conversation and that s a
great sin how can one judge father but even if one might what feeling
except veneration could such a man as my father evoke and i am so
contented and happy with him i only wish you were all as happy as i
am 

her brother shook his head incredulously 

 the only thing that is hard for me i will tell you the truth 
andrew is father s way of treating religious subjects i don t
understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is
as clear as day and can go so far astray that is the only thing
that makes me unhappy but even in this i can see lately a shade of
improvement his satire has been less bitter of late and there was a
monk he received and had a long talk with 

 ah my dear i am afraid you and your monk are wasting your
powder said prince andrew banteringly yet tenderly 

 ah mon ami i only pray and hope that god will hear me 
andrew she said timidly after a moment s silence i have a
great favor to ask of you 

 what is it dear 

 no promise that you will not refuse it will give you no trouble
and is nothing unworthy of you but it will comfort me promise 
andr sha said she putting her hand in her reticule but not yet
taking out what she was holding inside it as if what she held were
the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was
granted 

she looked timidly at her brother 

 even if it were a great deal of trouble answered prince andrew 
as if guessing what it was about 

 think what you please i know you are just like father think as
you please but do this for my sake please do father s father our
grandfather wore it in all his wars she still did not take out
what she was holding in her reticule so you promise 

 of course what is it 

 andrew i bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will
never take it off do you promise 

 if it does not weigh a hundredweight and won t break my neck 
to please you said prince andrew but immediately noticing
the pained expression his joke had brought to his sister s face he
repented and added i am glad really dear i am very glad 

 against your will he will save and have mercy on you and bring you
to himself for in him alone is truth and peace said she in a voice
trembling with emotion solemnly holding up in both hands before her
brother a small oval antique dark faced icon of the saviour in a gold
setting on a finely wrought silver chain 

she crossed herself kissed the icon and handed it to andrew 

 please andrew for my sake 

rays of gentle light shone from her large timid eyes those eyes lit
up the whole of her thin sickly face and made it beautiful her brother
would have taken the icon but she stopped him andrew understood 
crossed himself and kissed the icon there was a look of tenderness for
he was touched but also a gleam of irony on his face 

 thank you my dear she kissed him on the forehead and sat down
again on the sofa they were silent for a while 

 as i was saying to you andrew be kind and generous as you always
used to be don t judge lise harshly she began she is so
sweet so good natured and her position now is a very hard one 

 i do not think i have complained of my wife to you m sha or blamed
her why do you say all this to me 

red patches appeared on princess mary s face and she was silent as if
she felt guilty 

 i have said nothing to you but you have already been talked to and
i am sorry for that he went on 

the patches grew deeper on her forehead neck and cheeks she tried to
say something but could not her brother had guessed right the little
princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings
about her confinement and how she dreaded it and had complained of her
fate her father in law and her husband after crying she had fallen
asleep prince andrew felt sorry for his sister 

 know this m sha i can t reproach have not reproached and never
shall reproach my wife with anything and i cannot reproach myself
with anything in regard to her and that always will be so in whatever
circumstances i may be placed but if you want to know the truth if
you want to know whether i am happy no is she happy no but why this
is so i don t know 

as he said this he rose went to his sister and stooping kissed
her forehead his fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful kindly and
unaccustomed brightness but he was looking not at his sister but over
her head toward the darkness of the open doorway 

 let us go to her i must say good by or go and wake and i ll
come in a moment petr shka he called to his valet come here 
take these away put this on the seat and this to the right 

princess mary rose and moved to the door then stopped and said 
 andrew if you had faith you would have turned to god and asked him
to give you the love you do not feel and your prayer would have been
answered 

 well maybe said prince andrew go m sha i ll come
immediately 

on the way to his sister s room in the passage which connected one
wing with the other prince andrew met mademoiselle bourienne smiling
sweetly it was the third time that day that with an ecstatic and
artless smile she had met him in secluded passages 

 oh i thought you were in your room she said for some reason
blushing and dropping her eyes 

prince andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly
came over his face he said nothing to her but looked at her forehead
and hair without looking at her eyes with such contempt that the
frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word when he reached his
sister s room his wife was already awake and her merry voice hurrying
one word after another came through the open door she was speaking as
usual in french and as if after long self restraint she wished to make
up for lost time 

 no but imagine the old countess z bova with false curls and her
mouth full of false teeth as if she were trying to cheat old age 
ha ha ha mary 

this very sentence about countess z bova and this same laugh prince
andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some
five times he entered the room softly the little princess plump and
rosy was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands talking
incessantly repeating petersburg reminiscences and even phrases prince
andrew came up stroked her hair and asked if she felt rested after
their journey she answered him and continued her chatter 

the coach with six horses was waiting at the porch it was an autumn
night so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole 
servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch the immense
house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows the
domestic serfs were crowding in the hall waiting to bid good by to
the young prince the members of the household were all gathered in the
reception hall michael iv novich mademoiselle bourienne princess
mary and the little princess prince andrew had been called to his
father s study as the latter wished to say good by to him alone all
were waiting for them to come out 

when prince andrew entered the study the old man in his old age
spectacles and white dressing gown in which he received no one but his
son sat at the table writing he glanced round 

 going and he went on writing 

 i ve come to say good by 

 kiss me here and he touched his cheek thanks thanks 

 what do you thank me for 

 for not dilly dallying and not hanging to a woman s apron strings 
the service before everything thanks thanks and he went on
writing so that his quill spluttered and squeaked if you have
anything to say say it these two things can be done together he
added 

 about my wife i am ashamed as it is to leave her on your
hands 

 why talk nonsense say what you want 

 when her confinement is due send to moscow for an accoucheur let
him be here 

the old prince stopped writing and as if not understanding fixed his
stern eyes on his son 

 i know that no one can help if nature does not do her work said
prince andrew evidently confused i know that out of a million
cases only one goes wrong but it is her fancy and mine they have been
telling her things she has had a dream and is frightened 

 hm hm muttered the old prince to himself finishing what he
was writing i ll do it 

he signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to
laugh 

 it s a bad business eh 

 what is bad father 

 the wife said the old prince briefly and significantly 

 i don t understand said prince andrew 

 no it can t be helped lad said the prince they re
all like that one can t unmarry don t be afraid i won t tell
anyone but you know it yourself 

he seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers shook it looked
straight into his son s face with keen eyes which seemed to see
through him and again laughed his frigid laugh 

the son sighed thus admitting that his father had understood him the
old man continued to fold and seal his letter snatching up and throwing
down the wax the seal and the paper with his accustomed rapidity 

 what s to be done she s pretty i will do everything make your
mind easy said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter 

andrew did not speak he was both pleased and displeased that his father
understood him the old man got up and gave the letter to his son 

 listen said he don t worry about your wife what can be
done shall be now listen give this letter to michael ilari novich 
i have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not
keep you long as an adjutant a bad position tell him i remember
and like him write and tell me how he receives you if he is all
right serve him nicholas bolk nski s son need not serve under
anyone if he is in disfavor now come here 

 kut zov 

he spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words but his son
was accustomed to understand him he led him to the desk raised the
lid drew out a drawer and took out an exercise book filled with his
bold tall close handwriting 

 i shall probably die before you so remember these are my memoirs 
hand them to the emperor after my death now here is a lombard bond
and a letter it is a premium for the man who writes a history of
suv rov s wars send it to the academy here are some jottings for
you to read when i am gone you will find them useful 

andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time
yet he felt that he must not say it 

 i will do it all father he said 

 well now good by he gave his son his hand to kiss and embraced
him remember this prince andrew if they kill you it will hurt me 
your old father he paused unexpectedly and then in a querulous
voice suddenly shrieked but if i hear that you have not behaved like
a son of nicholas bolk nski i shall be ashamed 

 you need not have said that to me father said the son with a
smile 

the old man was silent 

 i also wanted to ask you continued prince andrew if i m
killed and if i have a son do not let him be taken away from you as i
said yesterday let him grow up with you please 

 not let the wife have him said the old man and laughed 

they stood silent facing one another the old man s sharp eyes were
fixed straight on his son s something twitched in the lower part of
the old prince s face 

 we ve said good by go he suddenly shouted in a loud angry
voice opening his door 

 what is it what asked both princesses when they saw for a moment
at the door prince andrew and the figure of the old man in a white
dressing gown spectacled and wigless shouting in an angry voice 

prince andrew sighed and made no reply 

 well he said turning to his wife 

and this well sounded coldly ironic as if he were saying now
go through your performance 

 andrew already said the little princess turning pale and
looking with dismay at her husband 

he embraced her she screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder 

he cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on looked into her face 
and carefully placed her in an easy chair 

 adieu mary said he gently to his sister taking her by the hand
and kissing her and then he left the room with rapid steps 

the little princess lay in the armchair mademoiselle bourienne chafing
her temples princess mary supporting her sister in law still looked
with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which prince
andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction from
the study like pistol shots came the frequent sound of the old man
angrily blowing his nose hardly had prince andrew gone when the study
door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white
dressing gown looked out 

 gone that s all right said he and looking angrily at the
unconscious little princess he shook his head reprovingly and slammed
the door 





book two 1805





chapter i

in october 1805 a russian army was occupying the villages and towns of
the archduchy of austria and yet other regiments freshly arriving from
russia were settling near the fortress of braunau and burdening the
inhabitants on whom they were quartered braunau was the headquarters of
the commander in chief kut zov 

on october 11 1805 one of the infantry regiments that had just reached
braunau had halted half a mile from the town waiting to be inspected
by the commander in chief despite the un russian appearance of the
locality and surroundings fruit gardens stone fences tiled roofs 
and hills in the distance and despite the fact that the inhabitants
 who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers were not russians the
regiment had just the appearance of any russian regiment preparing for
an inspection anywhere in the heart of russia 

on the evening of the last day s march an order had been received that
the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march though
the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander and
the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or
not it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders
to present the regiment in parade order on the principle that it is
always better to bow too low than not bow low enough so the
soldiers after a twenty mile march were kept mending and cleaning all
night long without closing their eyes while the adjutants and
company commanders calculated and reckoned and by morning the
regiment instead of the straggling disorderly crowd it had been on
its last march the day before presented a well ordered array of two
thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty had every button
and every strap in place and shone with cleanliness and not only
externally was all in order but had it pleased the commander in chief
to look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean
shirt and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles awl 
soap and all as the soldiers say there was only one circumstance
concerning which no one could be at ease it was the state of the
soldiers boots more than half the men s boots were in holes but
this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander for
in spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the austrian
commissariat and the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles 

the commander of the regiment was an elderly choleric stout and
thick set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers and wider from
chest to back than across the shoulders he had on a brand new uniform
showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes
which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders he
had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of
his life he walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled
himself up slightly arching his back it was plain that the commander
admired his regiment rejoiced in it and that his whole mind was
engrossed by it yet his strut seemed to indicate that besides military
matters social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his
thoughts 

 well michael m trich sir he said addressing one of the
battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward it was plain that
they both felt happy we had our hands full last night however i
think the regiment is not a bad one eh 

the battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed 

 it would not be turned off the field even on the tsar tsin
meadow 

 what asked the commander 

at that moment on the road from the town on which signalers had been
posted two men appeared on horse back they were an aide de camp
followed by a cossack 

the aide de camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been
clearly worded the day before namely that the commander in chief
wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on
the march in their greatcoats and packs and without any preparation
whatever 

a member of the hofkriegsrath from vienna had come to kut zov the day
before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of
the archduke ferdinand and mack and kut zov not considering this
junction advisable meant among other arguments in support of his view 
to show the austrian general the wretched state in which the troops
arrived from russia with this object he intended to meet the regiment 
so the worse the condition it was in the better pleased the commander
in chief would be though the aide de camp did not know these
circumstances he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the
men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order and that the
commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied on hearing this the
regimental commander hung his head silently shrugged his shoulders and
spread out his arms with a choleric gesture 

 a fine mess we ve made of it he remarked 

 there now didn t i tell you michael m trich that if it was said
 on the march it meant in greatcoats said he reproachfully to
the battalion commander oh my god he added stepping resolutely
forward company commanders he shouted in a voice accustomed to
command sergeants major how soon will he be here he asked
the aide de camp with a respectful politeness evidently relating to the
personage he was referring to 

 in an hour s time i should say 

 shall we have time to change clothes 

 i don t know general 

the regimental commander going up to the line himself ordered the
soldiers to change into their greatcoats the company commanders ran off
to their companies the sergeants major began bustling the greatcoats
were not in very good condition and instantly the squares that had up
to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and
hum with voices on all sides soldiers were running to and fro throwing
up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps
over their heads unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on
with upraised arms 

in half an hour all was again in order only the squares had become gray
instead of black the regimental commander walked with his jerky steps
to the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance 

 whatever is this this he shouted and stood still commander
of the third company 

 commander of the third company wanted by the general commander to
the general third company to the commander the words passed along
the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer 

when the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in
a cry of the general to the third company the missing officer
appeared from behind his company and though he was a middle aged man
and not in the habit of running trotted awkwardly stumbling on his
toes toward the general the captain s face showed the uneasiness of
a schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not learned spots
appeared on his nose the redness of which was evidently due to
intemperance and his mouth twitched nervously the general looked the
captain up and down as he came up panting slackening his pace as he
approached 

 you will soon be dressing your men in petticoats what is this 
shouted the regimental commander thrusting forward his jaw and pointing
at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish
cloth which contrasted with the others what have you been after 
the commander in chief is expected and you leave your place eh i ll
teach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade eh 

the commander of the company with his eyes fixed on his superior 
pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap as if in this
pressure lay his only hope of salvation 

 well why don t you speak whom have you got there dressed up as a
hungarian said the commander with an austere gibe 

 your excellency 

 well your excellency what your excellency but what about your
excellency nobody knows 

 your excellency it s the officer d lokhov who has been reduced
to the ranks said the captain softly 

 well has he been degraded into a field marshal or into a soldier 
if a soldier he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the
others 

 your excellency you gave him leave yourself on the march 

 gave him leave leave that s just like you young men said the
regimental commander cooling down a little leave indeed one says
a word to you and you what he added with renewed irritation i
beg you to dress your men decently 

and the commander turning to look at the adjutant directed his jerky
steps down the line he was evidently pleased at his own display of
anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for
wrath having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge at another
because his line was not straight he reached the third company 

 h o o w are you standing where s your leg your leg shouted
the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice while there were
still five men between him and d lokhov with his bluish gray uniform 

d lokhov slowly straightened his bent knee looking straight with his
clear insolent eyes in the general s face 

 why a blue coat off with it sergeant major change his coat 
the ras he did not finish 

 general i must obey orders but i am not bound to endure 
d lokhov hurriedly interrupted 

 no talking in the ranks no talking no talking 

 not bound to endure insults d lokhov concluded in loud ringing
tones 

the eyes of the general and the soldier met the general became silent 
angrily pulling down his tight scarf 

 i request you to have the goodness to change your coat he said as
he turned away 





chapter ii

 he s coming shouted the signaler at that moment 

the regimental commander flushing ran to his horse seized the stirrup
with trembling hands threw his body across the saddle righted himself 
drew his saber and with a happy and resolute countenance opening
his mouth awry prepared to shout the regiment fluttered like a bird
preening its plumage and became motionless 

 att ention shouted the regimental commander in a soul shaking
voice which expressed joy for himself severity for the regiment and
welcome for the approaching chief 

along the broad country road edged on both sides by trees came a high 
light blue viennese cal che slightly creaking on its springs and drawn
by six horses at a smart trot behind the cal che galloped the suite
and a convoy of croats beside kut zov sat an austrian general in
a white uniform that looked strange among the russian black ones the
cal che stopped in front of the regiment kut zov and the austrian
general were talking in low voices and kut zov smiled slightly as
treading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as if those two
thousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did
not exist 

the word of command rang out and again the regiment quivered as with a
jingling sound it presented arms then amidst a dead silence the
feeble voice of the commander in chief was heard the regiment roared 
 health to your ex len len lency and again all became
silent at first kut zov stood still while the regiment moved then he
and the general in white accompanied by the suite walked between the
ranks 

from the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and
devoured him with his eyes drawing himself up obsequiously and from
the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals bending forward
and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements and from the way he
darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief 
it was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even
greater zeal than his duty as a commander thanks to the strictness and
assiduity of its commander the regiment in comparison with others that
had reached braunau at the same time was in splendid condition there
were only 217 sick and stragglers everything was in good order except
the boots 

kut zov walked through the ranks sometimes stopping to say a few
friendly words to officers he had known in the turkish war sometimes
also to the soldiers looking at their boots he several times shook his
head sadly pointing them out to the austrian general with an expression
which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone but could not help
noticing what a bad state of things it was the regimental commander
ran forward on each such occasion fearing to miss a single word of the
commander in chief s regarding the regiment behind kut zov at a
distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard followed
some twenty men of his suite these gentlemen talked among themselves
and sometimes laughed nearest of all to the commander in chief walked
a handsome adjutant this was prince bolk nski beside him was his
comrade nesv tski a tall staff officer extremely stout with a
kindly smiling handsome face and moist eyes nesv tski could hardly
keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked
beside him this hussar with a grave face and without a smile or a
change in the expression of his fixed eyes watched the regimental
commander s back and mimicked his every movement each time the
commander started and bent forward the hussar started and bent forward
in exactly the same manner nesv tski laughed and nudged the others to
make them look at the wag 

kut zov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were
starting from their sockets to watch their chief on reaching the
third company he suddenly stopped his suite not having expected this 
involuntarily came closer to him 

 ah tim khin said he recognizing the red nosed captain who had
been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat 

one would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself
more than tim khin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental
commander but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew
himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained
it had the commander in chief continued to look at him and so kut zov 
who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good 
quickly turned away a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his
scarred and puffy face 

 another ismail comrade said he a brave officer are you
satisfied with him he asked the regimental commander 

and the latter unconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar
officer as in a looking glass started moved forward and answered 
 highly satisfied your excellency 

 we all have our weaknesses said kut zov smiling and walking away
from him he used to have a predilection for bacchus 

the regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did
not answer the hussar at that moment noticed the face of the red nosed
captain and his drawn in stomach and mimicked his expression and pose
with such exactitude that nesv tski could not help laughing kut zov
turned round the officer evidently had complete control of his face 
and while kut zov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume
a most serious deferential and innocent expression 

the third company was the last and kut zov pondered apparently trying
to recollect something prince andrew stepped forward from among the
suite and said in french 

 you told me to remind you of the officer d lokhov reduced to the
ranks in this regiment 

 where is d lokhov asked kut zov 

d lokhov who had already changed into a soldier s gray greatcoat 
did not wait to be called the shapely figure of the fair haired
soldier with his clear blue eyes stepped forward from the ranks went
up to the commander in chief and presented arms 

 have you a complaint to make kut zov asked with a slight frown 

 this is d lokhov said prince andrew 

 ah said kut zov i hope this will be a lesson to you do your
duty the emperor is gracious and i shan t forget you if you deserve
well 

the clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as
they had looked at the regimental commander seeming by their expression
to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief
so widely from a private 

 one thing i ask of your excellency d lokhov said in his firm 
ringing deliberate voice i ask an opportunity to atone for my fault
and prove my devotion to his majesty the emperor and to russia 

kut zov turned away the same smile of the eyes with which he had
turned from captain tim khin again flitted over his face he turned
away with a grimace as if to say that everything d lokhov had said to
him and everything he could say had long been known to him that he was
weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted he turned away and
went to the carriage 

the regiment broke up into companies which went to their appointed
quarters near braunau where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and
to rest after their hard marches 

 you won t bear me a grudge prokh r ign tych said the
regimental commander overtaking the third company on its way to its
quarters and riding up to captain tim khin who was walking in front 
 the regimental commander s face now that the inspection was happily
over beamed with irrepressible delight it s in the emperor s
service it can t be helped one is sometimes a bit hasty on
parade i am the first to apologize you know me he was very
pleased and he held out his hand to the captain 

 don t mention it general as if i d be so bold replied the
captain his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where
two front teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end
of a gun at ismail 

 and tell mr d lokhov that i won t forget him he may be quite
easy and tell me please i ve been meaning to ask how is he
behaving himself and in general 

 as far as the service goes he is quite punctilious your excellency 
but his character said tim khin 

 and what about his character asked the regimental commander 

 it s different on different days answered the captain one
day he is sensible well educated and good natured and the next he s
a wild beast in poland if you please he nearly killed a jew 

 oh well well remarked the regimental commander still one
must have pity on a young man in misfortune you know he has important
connections well then you just 

 i will your excellency said tim khin showing by his smile that
he understood his commander s wish 

 well of course of course 

the regimental commander sought out d lokhov in the ranks and reining
in his horse said to him 

 after the next affair epaulettes 

d lokhov looked round but did not say anything nor did the mocking
smile on his lips change 

 well that s all right continued the regimental commander a
cup of vodka for the men from me he added so that the soldiers
could hear i thank you all god be praised and he rode past that
company and overtook the next one 

 well he s really a good fellow one can serve under him said
tim khin to the subaltern beside him 

 in a word a hearty one said the subaltern laughing the
regimental commander was nicknamed king of hearts 

the cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the
soldiers the company marched on gaily the soldiers voices could be
heard on every side 

 and they said kut zov was blind of one eye 

 and so he is quite blind 

 no friend he is sharper eyed than you are boots and leg bands 
he noticed everything 

 when he looked at my feet friend well thinks i 

 and that other one with him the austrian looked as if he were
smeared with chalk as white as flour i suppose they polish him up as
they do the guns 

 i say f deshon did he say when the battles are to begin you
were near him everybody said that buonaparte himself was at braunau 

 buonaparte himself just listen to the fool what he doesn t
know the prussians are up in arms now the austrians you see are
putting them down when they ve been put down the war with buonaparte
will begin and he says buonaparte is in braunau shows you re a fool 
you d better listen more carefully 

 what devils these quartermasters are see the fifth company is
turning into the village already they will have their buckwheat
cooked before we reach our quarters 

 give me a biscuit you devil 

 and did you give me tobacco yesterday that s just it friend ah 
well never mind here you are 

 they might call a halt here or we ll have to do another four miles
without eating 

 wasn t it fine when those germans gave us lifts you just sit still
and are drawn along 

 and here friend the people are quite beggarly there they all
seemed to be poles all under the russian crown but here they re
all regular germans 

 singers to the front came the captain s order 

and from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front a
drummer their leader turned round facing the singers and flourishing
his arm began a long drawn out soldiers song commencing with the
words morning dawned the sun was rising and concluding on
then brothers on to glory led by father k menski this song had
been composed in the turkish campaign and now being sung in austria the
only change being that the words father k menski were replaced by
 father kut zov 

having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms
as if flinging something to the ground the drummer a lean handsome
soldier of forty looked sternly at the singers and screwed up his
eyes then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him 
he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious
object above his head and holding it there for some seconds suddenly
flung it down and began 

 oh my bower oh my bower 

 oh my bower new chimed in twenty voices and the castanet
player in spite of the burden of his equipment rushed out to the front
and walking backwards before the company jerked his shoulders and
flourished his castanets as if threatening someone the soldiers 
swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously marched with long
steps behind the company the sound of wheels the creaking of springs 
and the tramp of horses hoofs were heard kut zov and his suite were
returning to the town the commander in chief made a sign that the
men should continue to march at ease and he and all his suite showed
pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing
soldier and the gay and smartly marching men in the second file
from the right flank beside which the carriage passed the company 
a blue eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice it was d lokhov
marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and
looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that
moment marching with the company the hussar cornet of kut zov s
suite who had mimicked the regimental commander fell back from the
carriage and rode up to d lokhov 

hussar cornet zherk v had at one time in petersburg belonged to
the wild set led by d lokhov zherk v had met d lokhov abroad as a
private and had not seen fit to recognize him but now that kut zov had
spoken to the gentleman ranker he addressed him with the cordiality of
an old friend 

 my dear fellow how are you said he through the singing making
his horse keep pace with the company 

 how am i d lokhov answered coldly i am as you see 

the lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy
gaiety with which zherk v spoke and to the intentional coldness of
d lokhov s reply 

 and how do you get on with the officers inquired zherk v 

 all right they are good fellows and how have you wriggled onto the
staff 

 i was attached i m on duty 

both were silent 

 she let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve went the
song arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness 
their conversation would probably have been different but for the effect
of that song 

 is it true that austrians have been beaten asked d lokhov 

 the devil only knows they say so 

 i m glad answered d lokhov briefly and clearly as the song
demanded 

 i say come round some evening and we ll have a game of faro 
said zherk v 

 why have you too much money 

 do come 

 i can t i ve sworn not to i won t drink and won t play till
i get reinstated 

 well that s only till the first engagement 

 we shall see 

they were again silent 

 come if you need anything one can at least be of use on the
staff 

d lokhov smiled don t trouble if i want anything i won t
beg i ll take it 

 well never mind i only 

 and i only 

 good by 

 good health 

 it s a long long way 
 to my native land 


zherk v touched his horse with the spurs it pranced excitedly from
foot to foot uncertain with which to start then settled down galloped
past the company and overtook the carriage still keeping time to the
song 





chapter iii

on returning from the review kut zov took the austrian general into
his private room and calling his adjutant asked for some papers
relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival and the
letters that had come from the archduke ferdinand who was in command of
the advanced army prince andrew bolk nski came into the room with the
required papers kut zov and the austrian member of the hofkriegsrath
were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out 

 ah said kut zov glancing at bolk nski as if by this
exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait and he went on with the
conversation in french 

 all i can say general said he with a pleasant elegance
of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each
deliberately spoken word it was evident that kut zov himself listened
with pleasure to his own voice all i can say general is that if
the matter depended on my personal wishes the will of his majesty the
emperor francis would have been fulfilled long ago i should long
ago have joined the archduke and believe me on my honour that to me
personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command
of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful
general of whom austria has so many and to lay down all this heavy
responsibility but circumstances are sometimes too strong for us 
general 

and kut zov smiled in a way that seemed to say you are quite at
liberty not to believe me and i don t even care whether you do or
not but you have no grounds for telling me so and that is the whole
point 

the austrian general looked dissatisfied but had no option but to reply
in the same tone 

 on the contrary he said in a querulous and angry tone that
contrasted with his flattering words on the contrary your
excellency s participation in the common action is highly valued by
his majesty but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid
russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been
accustomed to win in their battles he concluded his evidently
prearranged sentence 

kut zov bowed with the same smile 

 but that is my conviction and judging by the last letter with which
his highness the archduke ferdinand has honored me i imagine that the
austrian troops under the direction of so skillful a leader as general
mack have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need
our aid said kut zov 

the general frowned though there was no definite news of an austrian
defeat there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors
that were afloat and so kut zov s suggestion of an austrian victory
sounded much like irony but kut zov went on blandly smiling with the
same expression which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose
so and in fact the last letter he had received from mack s army
informed him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the
army was very favorable 

 give me that letter said kut zov turning to prince andrew 
 please have a look at it and kut zov with an ironical smile
about the corners of his mouth read to the austrian general the
following passage in german from the archduke ferdinand s letter 

we have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with
which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the lech also 
as we are masters of ulm we cannot be deprived of the advantage of
commanding both sides of the danube so that should the enemy not
cross the lech we can cross the danube throw ourselves on his line
of communications recross the river lower down and frustrate his
intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful
ally we shall therefore confidently await the moment when the imperial
russian army will be fully equipped and shall then in conjunction with
it easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves 

kut zov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the
member of the hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively 

 but you know the wise maxim your excellency advising one to expect
the worst said the austrian general evidently wishing to have done
with jests and to come to business he involuntarily looked round at the
aide de camp 

 excuse me general interrupted kut zov also turning to prince
andrew look here my dear fellow get from kozl vski all the
reports from our scouts here are two letters from count nostitz and
here is one from his highness the archduke ferdinand and here are
these he said handing him several papers make a neat memorandum
in french out of all this showing all the news we have had of the
movements of the austrian army and then give it to his excellency 

prince andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the
first not only what had been said but also what kut zov would have
liked to tell him he gathered up the papers and with a bow to both 
stepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room 

though not much time had passed since prince andrew had left russia he
had changed greatly during that period in the expression of his face 
in his movements in his walk scarcely a trace was left of his former
affected languor and indolence he now looked like a man who has time
to think of the impression he makes on others but is occupied with
agreeable and interesting work his face expressed more satisfaction
with himself and those around him his smile and glance were brighter
and more attractive 

kut zov whom he had overtaken in poland had received him very kindly 
promised not to forget him distinguished him above the other adjutants 
and had taken him to vienna and given him the more serious commissions 
from vienna kut zov wrote to his old comrade prince andrew s father 

your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry 
firmness and expedition i consider myself fortunate to have such a
subordinate by me 

on kut zov s staff among his fellow officers and in the army
generally prince andrew had as he had had in petersburg society two
quite opposite reputations some a minority acknowledged him to be
different from themselves and from everyone else expected great things
of him listened to him admired and imitated him and with them prince
andrew was natural and pleasant others the majority disliked him and
considered him conceited cold and disagreeable but among these people
prince andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and even
feared him 

coming out of kut zov s room into the waiting room with the papers in
his hand prince andrew came up to his comrade the aide de camp on duty 
kozl vski who was sitting at the window with a book 

 well prince asked kozl vski 

 i am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not
advancing 

 and why is it 

prince andrew shrugged his shoulders 

 any news from mack 

 no 

 if it were true that he has been beaten news would have come 

 probably said prince andrew moving toward the outer door 

but at that instant a tall austrian general in a greatcoat with the
order of maria theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head 
who had evidently just arrived entered quickly slamming the door 
prince andrew stopped short 

 commander in chief kut zov said the newly arrived general
speaking quickly with a harsh german accent looking to both sides and
advancing straight toward the inner door 

 the commander in chief is engaged said kozl vski going
hurriedly up to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door 
 whom shall i announce 

the unknown general looked disdainfully down at kozl vski who was
rather short as if surprised that anyone should not know him 

 the commander in chief is engaged repeated kozl vski calmly 

the general s face clouded his lips quivered and trembled he took
out a notebook hurriedly scribbled something in pencil tore out the
leaf gave it to kozl vski stepped quickly to the window and threw
himself into a chair gazing at those in the room as if asking why
do they look at me then he lifted his head stretched his neck as
if he intended to say something but immediately with affected
indifference began to hum to himself producing a queer sound which
immediately broke off the door of the private room opened and kut zov
appeared in the doorway the general with the bandaged head bent forward
as though running away from some danger and making long quick strides
with his thin legs went up to kut zov 

 vous voyez le malheureux mack he uttered in a broken voice 

kut zov s face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly
immobile for a few moments then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave
and his forehead became smooth again he bowed his head respectfully 
closed his eyes silently let mack enter his room before him and closed
the door himself behind him 

the report which had been circulated that the austrians had been beaten
and that the whole army had surrendered at ulm proved to be correct 
within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with
orders which showed that the russian troops who had hitherto been
inactive would also soon have to meet the enemy 

prince andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest
lay in the general progress of the war when he saw mack and heard the
details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost 
understood all the difficulties of the russian army s position and
vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to
play involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the
humiliation of arrogant austria and that in a week s time he might 
perhaps see and take part in the first russian encounter with the
french since suv rov met them he feared that bonaparte s genius
might outweigh all the courage of the russian troops and at the same
time could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced 

excited and irritated by these thoughts prince andrew went toward his
room to write to his father to whom he wrote every day in the corridor
he met nesv tski with whom he shared a room and the wag zherk v 
they were as usual laughing 

 why are you so glum asked nesv tski noticing prince andrew s
pale face and glittering eyes 

 there s nothing to be gay about answered bolk nski 

just as prince andrew met nesv tski and zherk v there came toward
them from the other end of the corridor strauch an austrian general
who on kut zov s staff in charge of the provisioning of the russian
army and the member of the hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous
evening there was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to
pass the three officers quite easily but zherk v pushing nesv tski
aside with his arm said in a breathless voice 

 they re coming they re coming stand aside make way 
please make way 

the generals were passing by looking as if they wished to avoid
embarrassing attentions on the face of the wag zherk v there suddenly
appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress 

 your excellency said he in german stepping forward and
addressing the austrian general i have the honor to congratulate
you 

he bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the
other awkwardly like a child at a dancing lesson 

the member of the hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but seeing the
seriousness of his stupid smile could not but give him a moment s
attention he screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening 

 i have the honor to congratulate you general mack has arrived quite
well only a little bruised just here he added pointing with a
beaming smile to his head 

the general frowned turned away and went on 

 gott wie naiv said he angrily after he had gone a few steps 

 good god what simplicity 


nesv tski with a laugh threw his arms round prince andrew but
bolk nski turning still paler pushed him away with an angry look and
turned to zherk v the nervous irritation aroused by the appearance
of mack the news of his defeat and the thought of what lay before the
russian army found vent in anger at zherk v s untimely jest 

 if you sir choose to make a buffoon of yourself he said
sharply with a slight trembling of the lower jaw i can t prevent
your doing so but i warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my
presence i will teach you to behave yourself 

nesv tski and zherk v were so surprised by this outburst that they
gazed at bolk nski silently with wide open eyes 

 what s the matter i only congratulated them said zherk v 

 i am not jesting with you please be silent cried bolk nski 
and taking nesv tski s arm he left zherk v who did not know what to
say 

 come what s the matter old fellow said nesv tski trying to
soothe him 

 what s the matter exclaimed prince andrew standing still in
his excitement don t you understand that either we are officers
serving our tsar and our country rejoicing in the successes and
grieving at the misfortunes of our common cause or we are merely
lackeys who care nothing for their master s business quarante mille
hommes massacr s et l arm e de nos alli s d truite et vous
trouvez l le mot pour rire he said as if strengthening his
views by this french sentence c est bien pour un gar on de rien
comme cet individu dont vous avez fait un ami mais pas pour vous pas
pour vous 2 only a hobbledehoy could amuse himself in this
way he added in russian but pronouncing the word with a french
accent having noticed that zherk v could still hear him 

 forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies
 destroyed and you find that a cause for jesting 

 2 it is all very well for that good for nothing fellow
 of whom you have made a friend but not for you not for
 you 


he waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer but he turned
and went out of the corridor 





chapter iv

the p vlograd hussars were stationed two miles from braunau the
squadron in which nicholas rost v served as a cadet was quartered in
the german village of salzeneck the best quarters in the village were
assigned to cavalry captain den sov the squadron commander known
throughout the whole cavalry division as v ska den sov cadet rost v 
ever since he had overtaken the regiment in poland had lived with the
squadron commander 

on october 11 the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news
of mack s defeat the camp life of the officers of this squadron was
proceeding as usual den sov who had been losing at cards all night 
had not yet come home when rost v rode back early in the morning from
a foraging expedition rost v in his cadet uniform with a jerk to his
horse rode up to the porch swung his leg over the saddle with a supple
youthful movement stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to
part from his horse and at last sprang down and called to his orderly 

 ah bondar nko dear friend said he to the hussar who rushed up
headlong to the horse walk him up and down my dear fellow he
continued with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young
people show to everyone when they are happy 

 yes your excellency answered the ukrainian gaily tossing his
head 

 mind walk him up and down well 

another hussar also rushed toward the horse but bondar nko had already
thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse s head it was
evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to
serve him rost v patted the horse s neck and then his flank and
lingered for a moment 

 splendid what a horse he will be he thought with a smile and
holding up his saber his spurs jingling he ran up the steps of the
porch his landlord who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap pitchfork in
hand was clearing manure from the cowhouse looked out and his face
immediately brightened on seeing rost v sch n gut morgen sch n
gut morgen he said winking with a merry smile evidently pleased
to greet the young man 

 a very good morning a very good morning 


 schon fleissig said rost v with the same gay brotherly smile
which did not leave his eager face hoch oestreicher hoch russen 
kaiser alexander hoch 2 said he quoting words often repeated by
the german landlord 

 busy already 

 2 hurrah for the austrians hurrah for the russians 
 hurrah for emperor alexander 


the german laughed came out of the cowshed pulled off his cap and
waving it above his head cried 

 und die ganze welt hoch 

 and hurrah for the whole world 


rost v waved his cap above his head like the german and cried laughing 
 und vivat die ganze welt though neither the german cleaning his
cowshed nor rost v back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any
reason for rejoicing they looked at each other with joyful delight and
brotherly love wagged their heads in token of their mutual affection 
and parted smiling the german returning to his cowshed and rost v
going to the cottage he occupied with den sov 

 what about your master he asked lavr shka den sov s orderly 
whom all the regiment knew for a rogue 

 hasn t been in since the evening must have been losing 
answered lavr shka i know by now if he wins he comes back early to
brag about it but if he stays out till morning it means he s lost and
will come back in a rage will you have coffee 

 yes bring some 

ten minutes later lavr shka brought the coffee he s coming 
said he now for trouble rost v looked out of the window and
saw den sov coming home den sov was a small man with a red face 
sparkling black eyes and black tousled mustache and hair he wore an
unfastened cloak wide breeches hanging down in creases and a crumpled
shako on the back of his head he came up to the porch gloomily hanging
his head 

 lavw ska he shouted loudly and angrily take it off 
blockhead 

 well i am taking it off replied lavr shka s voice 

 ah you re up already said den sov entering the room 

 long ago answered rost v i have already been for the hay 
and have seen fr ulein mathilde 

 weally and i ve been losing bwother i lost yesterday like a
damned fool cried den sov not pronouncing his r s such ill
luck such ill luck as soon as you left it began and went on hullo
there tea 

puckering up his face though smiling and showing his short strong
teeth he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick
tangled black hair 

 and what devil made me go to that wat an officer nicknamed
 the rat he said rubbing his forehead and whole face with both
hands just fancy he didn t let me win a single cahd not one
cahd 

he took the lighted pipe that was offered to him gripped it in his
fist and tapped it on the floor making the sparks fly while he
continued to shout 

 he lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it 
gives the singles and snatches the doubles 

he scattered the burning tobacco smashed the pipe and threw it away 
then he remained silent for a while and all at once looked cheerfully
with his glittering black eyes at rost v 

 if at least we had some women here but there s nothing foh one
to do but dwink if we could only get to fighting soon hullo who s
there he said turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy
boots and the clinking of spurs that came to a stop and a respectful
cough 

 the squadron quartermaster said lavr shka 

den sov s face puckered still more 

 wetched he muttered throwing down a purse with some gold in it 
 wost v deah fellow just see how much there is left and shove the
purse undah the pillow he said and went out to the quartermaster 

rost v took the money and mechanically arranging the old and new coins
in separate piles began counting them 

 ah tely nin how d ye do they plucked me last night came
den sov s voice from the next room 

 where at bykov s at the rat s i knew it replied a piping
voice and lieutenant tely nin a small officer of the same squadron 
entered the room 

rost v thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand
which was offered him tely nin for some reason had been transferred
from the guards just before this campaign he behaved very well in the
regiment but was not liked rost v especially detested him and was
unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man 

 well young cavalryman how is my rook behaving he asked rook
was a young horse tely nin had sold to rost v 

the lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the
face his eyes continually wandered from one object to another 

 i saw you riding this morning he added 

 oh he s all right a good horse answered rost v though the
horse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half
that sum he s begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg he
added 

 the hoof s cracked that s nothing i ll teach you what to do
and show you what kind of rivet to use 

 yes please do said rost v 

 i ll show you i ll show you it s not a secret and it s a
horse you ll thank me for 

 then i ll have it brought round said rost v wishing to avoid
tely nin and he went out to give the order 

in the passage den sov with a pipe was squatting on the threshold
facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him on seeing rost v 
den sov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his
thumb to the room where tely nin was sitting he frowned and gave a
shudder of disgust 

 ugh i don t like that fellow he said regardless of the
quartermaster s presence 

rost v shrugged his shoulders as much as to say nor do i but
what s one to do and having given his order he returned to
tely nin 

tely nin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which rost v had
left him rubbing his small white hands 

 well there certainly are disgusting people thought rost v as he
entered 

 have you told them to bring the horse asked tely nin getting up
and looking carelessly about him 

 i have 

 let us go ourselves i only came round to ask den sov about
yesterday s order have you got it den sov 

 not yet but where are you off to 

 i want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse said
tely nin 

they went through the porch and into the stable the lieutenant
explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters 

when rost v went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the
table den sov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of
paper he looked gloomily in rost v s face and said i am witing
to her 

he leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and 
evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to
write told rost v the contents of his letter 

 you see my fwiend he said we sleep when we don t love we
are childwen of the dust but one falls in love and one is a god one
is pua as on the fihst day of cweation who s that now send him
to the devil i m busy he shouted to lavr shka who went up to
him not in the least abashed 

 who should it be you yourself told him to come it s the
quartermaster for the money 

den sov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped 

 wetched business he muttered to himself how much is left in
the puhse he asked turning to rost v 

 seven new and three old imperials 

 oh it s wetched well what are you standing there for you
sca cwow call the quahtehmasteh he shouted to lavr shka 

 please den sov let me lend you some i have some you know 
said rost v blushing 

 don t like bowwowing from my own fellows i don t growled
den sov 

 but if you won t accept money from me like a comrade you will
offend me really i have some rost v repeated 

 no i tell you 

and den sov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow 

 where have you put it wost v 

 under the lower pillow 

 it s not there 

den sov threw both pillows on the floor the purse was not there 

 that s a miwacle 

 wait haven t you dropped it said rost v picking up the
pillows one at a time and shaking them 

he pulled off the quilt and shook it the purse was not there 

 dear me can i have forgotten no i remember thinking that you kept
it under your head like a treasure said rost v i put it just
here where is it he asked turning to lavr shka 

 i haven t been in the room it must be where you put it 

 but it isn t 

 you re always like that you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget
it feel in your pockets 

 no if i hadn t thought of it being a treasure said rost v 
 but i remember putting it there 

lavr shka turned all the bedding over looked under the bed and under
the table searched everywhere and stood still in the middle of the
room den sov silently watched lavr shka s movements and when the
latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found
den sov glanced at rost v 

 wost v you ve not been playing schoolboy twicks 

rost v felt den sov s gaze fixed on him raised his eyes and
instantly dropped them again all the blood which had seemed congested
somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes he could not
draw breath 

 and there hasn t been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and
yourselves it must be here somewhere said lavr shka 

 now then you devil s puppet look alive and hunt for it 
shouted den sov suddenly turning purple and rushing at the man with
a threatening gesture if the purse isn t found i ll flog you 
i ll flog you all 

rost v his eyes avoiding den sov began buttoning his coat buckled
on his saber and put on his cap 

 i must have that purse i tell you shouted den sov shaking his
orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall 

 den sov let him alone i know who has taken it said rost v 
going toward the door without raising his eyes den sov paused thought
a moment and evidently understanding what rost v hinted at seized
his arm 

 nonsense he cried and the veins on his forehead and neck stood
out like cords you are mad i tell you i won t allow it 
the purse is here i ll flay this scoundwel alive and it will be
found 

 i know who has taken it repeated rost v in an unsteady voice 
and went to the door 

 and i tell you don t you dahe to do it shouted den sov 
rushing at the cadet to restrain him 

but rost v pulled away his arm and with as much anger as though
den sov were his worst enemy firmly fixed his eyes directly on his
face 

 do you understand what you re saying he said in a trembling
voice there was no one else in the room except myself so that if it
is not so then 

he could not finish and ran out of the room 

 ah may the devil take you and evewybody were the last words
rost v heard 

rost v went to tely nin s quarters 

 the master is not in he s gone to headquarters said
tely nin s orderly has something happened he added surprised
at the cadet s troubled face 

 no nothing 

 you ve only just missed him said the orderly 

the headquarters were situated two miles away from salzeneck and
rost v without returning home took a horse and rode there there was
an inn in the village which the officers frequented rost v rode up to
it and saw tely nin s horse at the porch 

in the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of
sausages and a bottle of wine 

 ah you ve come here too young man he said smiling and
raising his eyebrows 

 yes said rost v as if it cost him a great deal to utter the
word and he sat down at the nearest table 

both were silent there were two germans and a russian officer in the
room no one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives
and the munching of the lieutenant 

when tely nin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double
purse and drawing its rings aside with his small white turned up
fingers drew out a gold imperial and lifting his eyebrows gave it to
the waiter 

 please be quick he said 

the coin was a new one rost v rose and went up to tely nin 

 allow me to look at your purse he said in a low almost
inaudible voice 

with shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised tely nin handed him the
purse 

 yes it s a nice purse yes yes he said growing suddenly
pale and added look at it young man 

rost v took the purse in his hand examined it and the money in it and
looked at tely nin the lieutenant was looking about in his usual way
and suddenly seemed to grow very merry 

 if we get to vienna i ll get rid of it there but in these wretched
little towns there s nowhere to spend it said he well let me
have it young man i m going 

rost v did not speak 

 and you are you going to have lunch too they feed you quite
decently here continued tely nin now then let me have it 

he stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse rost v let go of
it tely nin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the
pocket of his riding breeches with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth
slightly open as if to say yes yes i am putting my purse in my
pocket and that s quite simple and is no one else s business 

 well young man he said with a sigh and from under his lifted
brows he glanced into rost v s eyes 

some flash as of an electric spark shot from tely nin s eyes to
rost v s and back and back again and again in an instant 

 come here said rost v catching hold of tely nin s arm and
almost dragging him to the window that money is den sov s you
took it he whispered just above tely nin s ear 

 what what how dare you what said tely nin 

but these words came like a piteous despairing cry and an entreaty for
pardon as soon as rost v heard them an enormous load of doubt
fell from him he was glad and at the same instant began to pity the
miserable man who stood before him but the task he had begun had to be
completed 

 heaven only knows what the people here may imagine muttered
tely nin taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room we
must have an explanation 

 i know it and shall prove it said rost v 

 i 

every muscle of tely nin s pale terrified face began to quiver his
eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising
to rost v s face and his sobs were audible 

 count don t ruin a young fellow here is this wretched money 
take it he threw it on the table i have an old father and
mother 

rost v took the money avoiding tely nin s eyes and went out of the
room without a word but at the door he stopped and then retraced his
steps o god he said with tears in his eyes how could you do
it 

 count said tely nin drawing nearer to him 

 don t touch me said rost v drawing back if you need it 
take the money and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn 





chapter v

that same evening there was an animated discussion among the
squadron s officers in den sov s quarters 

 and i tell you rost v that you must apologize to the colonel 
said a tall grizzly haired staff captain with enormous mustaches and
many wrinkles on his large features to rost v who was crimson with
excitement 

the staff captain k rsten had twice been reduced to the ranks for
affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission 

 i will allow no one to call me a liar cried rost v he told
me i lied and i told him he lied and there it rests he may keep me
on duty every day or may place me under arrest but no one can make
me apologize because if he as commander of this regiment thinks it
beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction then 

 you just wait a moment my dear fellow and listen interrupted
the staff captain in his deep bass calmly stroking his long mustache 
 you tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an
officer has stolen 

 i m not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of
other officers perhaps i ought not to have spoken before them but i am
not a diplomatist that s why i joined the hussars thinking that here
one would not need finesse and he tells me that i am lying so let him
give me satisfaction 

 that s all right no one thinks you a coward but that s not the
point ask den sov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to
demand satisfaction of his regimental commander 

den sov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the
conversation evidently with no wish to take part in it he answered the
staff captain s question by a disapproving shake of his head 

 you speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other
officers continued the staff captain and bogd nich the
colonel was called bogd nich shuts you up 

 he did not shut me up he said i was telling an untruth 

 well have it so and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must
apologize 

 not on any account exclaimed rost v 

 i did not expect this of you said the staff captain seriously and
severely you don t wish to apologize but man it s not only to
him but to the whole regiment all of us you re to blame all round 
the case is this you ought to have thought the matter over and
taken advice but no you go and blurt it all straight out before the
officers now what was the colonel to do have the officer tried and
disgrace the whole regiment disgrace the whole regiment because of one
scoundrel is that how you look at it we don t see it like that and
bogd nich was a brick he told you you were saying what was not true 
it s not pleasant but what s to be done my dear fellow you landed
yourself in it and now when one wants to smooth the thing over some
conceit prevents your apologizing and you wish to make the whole
affair public you are offended at being put on duty a bit but why not
apologize to an old and honorable officer whatever bogd nich may
be anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel you re quick at
taking offense but you don t mind disgracing the whole regiment 
the staff captain s voice began to tremble you have been in the
regiment next to no time my lad you re here today and tomorrow
you ll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when
it is said there are thieves among the p vlograd officers but
it s not all the same to us am i not right den sov it s not the
same 

den sov remained silent and did not move but occasionally looked with
his glittering black eyes at rost v 

 you value your own pride and don t wish to apologize continued
the staff captain but we old fellows who have grown up in and god
willing are going to die in the regiment we prize the honor of the
regiment and bogd nich knows it oh we do prize it old fellow and
all this is not right it s not right you may take offense or not but
i always stick to mother truth it s not right 

and the staff captain rose and turned away from rost v 

 that s twue devil take it shouted den sov jumping up now
then wost v now then 

rost v growing red and pale alternately looked first at one officer
and then at the other 

 no gentlemen no you mustn t think i quite understand 
you re wrong to think that of me i for me for the honor of
the regiment i d ah well i ll show that in action and for me
the honor of the flag well never mind it s true i m to blame 
to blame all round well what else do you want 

 come that s right count cried the staff captain turning
round and clapping rost v on the shoulder with his big hand 

 i tell you shouted den sov he s a fine fellow 

 that s better count said the staff captain beginning to
address rost v by his title as if in recognition of his confession 
 go and apologize your excellency yes go 

 gentlemen i ll do anything no one shall hear a word from me 
said rost v in an imploring voice but i can t apologize by god i
can t do what you will how can i go and apologize like a little boy
asking forgiveness 

den sov began to laugh 

 it ll be worse for you bogd nich is vindictive and you ll pay
for your obstinacy said k rsten 

 no on my word it s not obstinacy i can t describe the feeling 
i can t 

 well it s as you like said the staff captain and what has
become of that scoundrel he asked den sov 

 he has weported himself sick he s to be stwuck off the list
tomowwow muttered den sov 

 it is an illness there s no other way of explaining it said
the staff captain 

 illness or not he d better not cwoss my path i d kill him 
shouted den sov in a bloodthirsty tone 

just then zherk v entered the room 

 what brings you here cried the officers turning to the newcomer 

 we re to go into action gentlemen mack has surrendered with his
whole army 

 it s not true 

 i ve seen him myself 

 what saw the real mack with hands and feet 

 into action into action bring him a bottle for such news but how
did you come here 

 i ve been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil 
mack an austrian general complained of me i congratulated him on
mack s arrival what s the matter rost v you look as if you d
just come out of a hot bath 

 oh my dear fellow we re in such a stew here these last two
days 

the regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by
zherk v they were under orders to advance next day 

 we re going into action gentlemen 

 well thank god we ve been sitting here too long 





chapter vi

kut zov fell back toward vienna destroying behind him the bridges over
the rivers inn at braunau and traun near linz on october 23 the
russian troops were crossing the river enns at midday the russian
baggage train the artillery and columns of troops were defiling
through the town of enns on both sides of the bridge 

it was a warm rainy autumnal day the wide expanse that opened out
before the heights on which the russian batteries stood guarding the
bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain and
then suddenly spread out in the sunlight far distant objects could
be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished down below 
the little town could be seen with its white red roofed houses its
cathedral and its bridge on both sides of which streamed jostling
masses of russian troops at the bend of the danube vessels an island 
and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of
the enns and the danube became visible and the rocky left bank of the
danube covered with pine forests with a mystic background of green
treetops and bluish gorges the turrets of a convent stood out beyond a
wild virgin pine forest and far away on the other side of the enns the
enemy s horse patrols could be discerned 

among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of
the rearguard stood with a staff officer scanning the country through
his fieldglass a little behind them nesv tski who had been sent to
the rearguard by the commander in chief was sitting on the trail of a
gun carriage a cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack
and a flask and nesv tski was treating some officers to pies and real
doppelk mmel the officers gladly gathered round him some on their
knees some squatting turkish fashion on the wet grass 

 yes the austrian prince who built that castle was no fool it s
a fine place why are you not eating anything gentlemen nesv tski
was saying 

 thank you very much prince answered one of the officers pleased
to be talking to a staff officer of such importance it s a lovely
place we passed close to the park and saw two deer and what a
splendid house 

 look prince said another who would have dearly liked to take
another pie but felt shy and therefore pretended to be examining the
countryside see our infantrymen have already got there look there
in the meadow behind the village three of them are dragging something 
they ll ransack that castle he remarked with evident approval 

 so they will said nesv tski no but what i should like 
added he munching a pie in his moist lipped handsome mouth would be
to slip in over there 

he pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery and his eyes narrowed and
gleamed 

 that would be fine gentlemen 

the officers laughed 

 just to flutter the nuns a bit they say there are italian girls
among them on my word i d give five years of my life for it 

 they must be feeling dull too said one of the bolder officers 
laughing 

meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to
the general who looked through his field glass 

 yes so it is so it is said the general angrily lowering the
field glass and shrugging his shoulders so it is they ll be fired
on at the crossing and why are they dawdling there 

on the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye and from
their battery a milk white cloud arose then came the distant report of
a shot and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing 

nesv tski rose puffing and went up to the general smiling 

 would not your excellency like a little refreshment he said 

 it s a bad business said the general without answering him 
 our men have been wasting time 

 hadn t i better ride over your excellency asked nesv tski 

 yes please do answered the general and he repeated the order
that had already once been given in detail and tell the hussars
that they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as i ordered and the
inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected 

 very good answered nesv tski 

he called the cossack with his horse told him to put away the knapsack
and flask and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle 

 i ll really call in on the nuns he said to the officers who
watched him smilingly and he rode off by the winding path down the
hill 

 now then let s see how far it will carry captain just try 
said the general turning to an artillery officer have a little fun
to pass the time 

 crew to your guns commanded the officer 

in a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began
loading 

 one came the command 

number one jumped briskly aside the gun rang out with a deafening
metallic roar and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our
troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy a little smoke
showing the spot where it burst 

the faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound everyone got
up and began watching the movements of our troops below as plainly
visible as if but a stone s throw away and the movements of the
approaching enemy farther off at the same instant the sun came fully
out from behind the clouds and the clear sound of the solitary shot
and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and
spirited impression 





chapter vii

two of the enemy s shots had already flown across the bridge where
there was a crush halfway across stood prince nesv tski who had
alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the
railings he looked back laughing to the cossack who stood a few
steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles each time prince
nesv tski tried to move on soldiers and carts pushed him back again
and pressed him against the railings and all he could do was to smile 

 what a fine fellow you are friend said the cossack to a convoy
soldier with a wagon who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were
crowded together close to his wheels and his horses what a fellow 
you can t wait a moment don t you see the general wants to pass 

but the convoyman took no notice of the word general and shouted
at the soldiers who were blocking his way hi there boys keep to
the left wait a bit but the soldiers crowded together shoulder to
shoulder their bayonets interlocking moved over the bridge in a dense
mass looking down over the rails prince nesv tski saw the rapid noisy
little waves of the enns which rippling and eddying round the piles of
the bridge chased each other along looking on the bridge he saw equally
uniform living waves of soldiers shoulder straps covered shakos 
knapsacks bayonets long muskets and under the shakos faces with
broad cheekbones sunken cheeks and listless tired expressions and
feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the
bridge sometimes through the monotonous waves of men like a fleck of
white foam on the waves of the enns an officer in a cloak and with
a type of face different from that of the men squeezed his way along 
sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river an hussar on foot 
an orderly or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry 
and sometimes like a log floating down the river an officers or
company s baggage wagon piled high leather covered and hemmed in on
all sides moved across the bridge 

 it s as if a dam had burst said the cossack hopelessly are
there many more of you to come 

 a million all but one replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat 
with a wink and passed on followed by another an old man 

 if he he meant the enemy begins popping at the bridge now 
said the old soldier dismally to a comrade you ll forget to
scratch yourself 

that soldier passed on and after him came another sitting on a cart 

 where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to said an
orderly running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it 

and he also passed on with the wagon then came some merry soldiers who
had evidently been drinking 

 and then old fellow he gives him one in the teeth with the butt
end of his gun a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said
gaily with a wide swing of his arm 

 yes the ham was just delicious answered another with a loud
laugh and they too passed on so that nesv tski did not learn who
had been struck on the teeth or what the ham had to do with it 

 bah how they scurry he just sends a ball and they think they ll
all be killed a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully 

 as it flies past me daddy the ball i mean said a young soldier
with an enormous mouth hardly refraining from laughing i felt like
dying of fright i did pon my word i got that frightened said
he as if bragging of having been frightened 

that one also passed then followed a cart unlike any that had gone
before it was a german cart with a pair of horses led by a german and
seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects a fine brindled cow with
a large udder was attached to the cart behind a woman with an unweaned
baby an old woman and a healthy german girl with bright red cheeks
were sitting on some feather beds evidently these fugitives were
allowed to pass by special permission the eyes of all the soldiers
turned toward the women and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace
all the soldiers remarks related to the two young ones every face
bore almost the same smile expressing unseemly thoughts about the
women 

 just see the german sausage is making tracks too 

 sell me the missis said another soldier addressing the german 
who angry and frightened strode energetically along with downcast
eyes 

 see how smart she s made herself oh the devils 

 there fed tov you should be quartered on them 

 i have seen as much before now mate 

 where are you going asked an infantry officer who was eating an
apple also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl 

the german closed his eyes signifying that he did not understand 

 take it if you like said the officer giving the girl an apple 

the girl smiled and took it nesv tski like the rest of the men on the
bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed when
they had gone by the same stream of soldiers followed with the same
kind of talk and at last all stopped as often happens the horses of
a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge and the whole
crowd had to wait 

 and why are they stopping there s no proper order said the
soldiers where are you shoving to devil take you can t you wait 
it ll be worse if he fires the bridge see here s an officer jammed
in too different voices were saying in the crowd as the men looked
at one another and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge 

looking down at the waters of the enns under the bridge nesv tski
suddenly heard a sound new to him of something swiftly approaching 
something big that splashed into the water 

 just see where it carries to a soldier near by said sternly 
looking round at the sound 

 encouraging us to get along quicker said another uneasily 

the crowd moved on again nesv tski realized that it was a cannon ball 

 hey cossack my horse he said now then you there get out
of the way make way 

with great difficulty he managed to get to his horse and shouting
continually he moved on the soldiers squeezed themselves to make way
for him but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg and those
nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still
harder from behind 

 nesv tski nesv tski you numskull came a hoarse voice from
behind him 

nesv tski looked round and saw some fifteen paces away but separated
by the living mass of moving infantry v ska den sov red and shaggy 
with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily
over his shoulder 

 tell these devils these fiends to let me pass shouted den sov
evidently in a fit of rage his coal black eyes with their bloodshot
whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small
bare hand as red as his face 

 ah v ska joyfully replied nesv tski what s up with
you 

 the squadwon can t pass shouted v ska den sov showing his
white teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred arab which
twitched its ears as the bayonets touched it and snorted spurting
white foam from his bit tramping the planks of the bridge with his
hoofs and apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let
him what is this they re like sheep just like sheep out of the
way let us pass stop there you devil with the cart i ll hack
you with my saber he shouted actually drawing his saber from its
scabbard and flourishing it 

the soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces and
den sov joined nesv tski 

 how s it you re not drunk today said nesv tski when the
other had ridden up to him 

 they don t even give one time to dwink answered v ska
den sov they keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day if they
mean to fight let s fight but the devil knows what this is 

 what a dandy you are today said nesv tski looking at
den sov s new cloak and saddlecloth 

den sov smiled took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused
a smell of perfume and put it to nesv tski s nose 

 of course i m going into action i ve shaved bwushed my teeth 
and scented myself 

the imposing figure of nesv tski followed by his cossack and
the determination of den sov who flourished his sword and shouted
frantically had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through
to the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry beside the
bridge nesv tski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order 
and having done this he rode back 

having cleared the way den sov stopped at the end of the bridge 
carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the
ground eager to rejoin its fellows he watched his squadron draw
nearer then the clang of hoofs as of several horses galloping 
resounded on the planks of the bridge and the squadron officers in
front and men four abreast spread across the bridge and began to emerge
on his side of it 

the infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the
trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of ill will 
estrangement and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually
encounter one another at the clean smart hussars who moved past them in
regular order 

 smart lads only fit for a fair said one 

 what good are they they re led about just for show remarked
another 

 don t kick up the dust you infantry jested an hussar whose
prancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers 

 i d like to put you on a two days march with a knapsack your
fine cords would soon get a bit rubbed said an infantryman wiping
the mud off his face with his sleeve perched up there you re more
like a bird than a man 

 there now z kin they ought to put you on a horse you d look
fine said a corporal chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under
the weight of his knapsack 

 take a stick between your legs that ll suit you for a horse 
the hussar shouted back 





chapter viii

the last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge squeezing
together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel at last
the baggage wagons had all crossed the crush was less and the last
battalion came onto the bridge only den sov s squadron of hussars
remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy who could
be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from
the bridge for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the
river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away 
at the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our
cossack scouts were moving suddenly on the road at the top of the high
ground artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen these were the
french a group of cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot all
the officers and men of den sov s squadron though they tried to talk
of other things and to look in other directions thought only of what
was there on the hilltop and kept constantly looking at the patches
appearing on the skyline which they knew to be the enemy s troops 
the weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending
brightly upon the danube and the dark hills around it it was calm and
at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard
from the hill there was no one now between the squadron and the enemy
except a few scattered skirmishers an empty space of some seven hundred
yards was all that separated them the enemy ceased firing and that
stern threatening inaccessible and intangible line which separates
two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt 

 one step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing
the living from the dead lies uncertainty suffering and death and
what is there who is there there beyond that field that tree that
roof lit up by the sun no one knows but one wants to know you fear
and yet long to cross that line and know that sooner or later it must
be crossed and you will have to find out what is there just as you will
inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death but you are
strong healthy cheerful and excited and are surrounded by other such
excitedly animated and healthy men so thinks or at any rate
feels anyone who comes in sight of the enemy and that feeling gives
a particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything that
takes place at such moments 

on the high ground where the enemy was the smoke of a cannon rose 
and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron the
officers who had been standing together rode off to their places the
hussars began carefully aligning their horses silence fell on the whole
squadron all were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron
commander awaiting the word of command a second and a third cannon
ball flew past evidently they were firing at the hussars but the balls
with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell
somewhere beyond them the hussars did not look round but at the sound
of each shot as at the word of command the whole squadron with its
rows of faces so alike yet so different holding its breath while the
ball flew past rose in the stirrups and sank back again the soldiers
without turning their heads glanced at one another curious to see their
comrades impression every face from den sov s to that of the
bugler showed one common expression of conflict irritation and
excitement around chin and mouth the quartermaster frowned looking
at the soldiers as if threatening to punish them cadet mir nov ducked
every time a ball flew past rost v on the left flank mounted on his
rook a handsome horse despite its game leg had the happy air of a
schoolboy called up before a large audience for an examination in which
he feels sure he will distinguish himself he was glancing at everyone
with a clear bright expression as if asking them to notice how calmly
he sat under fire but despite himself on his face too that same
indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth 

 who s that curtseying there cadet miw nov that s not wight 
look at me cried den sov who unable to keep still on one spot 
kept turning his horse in front of the squadron 

the black hairy snub nosed face of v ska den sov and his whole
short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in
which he held the hilt of his naked saber looked just as it usually
did especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle he
was only redder than usual with his shaggy head thrown back like birds
when they drink pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his
good horse bedouin and sitting as though falling backwards in the
saddle he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in
a hoarse voice to the men to look to their pistols he rode up to
k rsten the staff captain on his broad backed steady mare came at a
walk to meet him his face with its long mustache was serious as always 
only his eyes were brighter than usual 

 well what about it said he to den sov it won t come to a
fight you ll see we shall retire 

 the devil only knows what they re about muttered den sov 
 ah wost v he cried noticing the cadet s bright face 
 you ve got it at last 

and he smiled approvingly evidently pleased with the cadet rost v
felt perfectly happy just then the commander appeared on the bridge 
den sov galloped up to him 

 your excellency let us attack them i ll dwive them off 

 attack indeed said the colonel in a bored voice puckering up his
face as if driving off a troublesome fly and why are you stopping
here don t you see the skirmishers are retreating lead the squadron
back 

the squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without
having lost a single man the second squadron that had been in the front
line followed them across and the last cossacks quitted the farther side
of the river 

the two p vlograd squadrons having crossed the bridge retired up the
hill one after the other their colonel karl bogd nich schubert came
up to den sov s squadron and rode at a footpace not far from rost v 
without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the
first time since their encounter concerning tely nin rost v feeling
that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now
admitted that he had been to blame did not lift his eyes from the
colonel s athletic back his nape covered with light hair and his red
neck it seemed to rost v that bogd nich was only pretending not
to notice him and that his whole aim now was to test the cadet s
courage so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily then it
seemed to him that bogd nich rode so near in order to show him his
courage next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a
desperate attack just to punish him rost v then he imagined how 
after the attack bogd nich would come up to him as he lay wounded and
would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation 

the high shouldered figure of zherk v familiar to the p vlograds as
he had but recently left their regiment rode up to the colonel 
after his dismissal from headquarters zherk v had not remained in the
regiment saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he
could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff and had succeeded
in attaching himself as an orderly officer to prince bagrati n he now
came to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear
guard 

 colonel he said addressing rost v s enemy with an air of
gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades there is an order
to stop and fire the bridge 

 an order to who asked the colonel morosely 

 i don t myself know to who replied the cornet in a
serious tone but the prince told me to go and tell the colonel
that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge 

zherk v was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the
colonel of hussars with the same order after him the stout nesv tski
came galloping up on a cossack horse that could scarcely carry his
weight 

 how s this colonel he shouted as he approached i told you
to fire the bridge and now someone has gone and blundered they are all
beside themselves over there and one can t make anything out 

the colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to nesv tski 

 you spoke to me of inflammable material said he but you said
nothing about firing it 

 but my dear sir said nesv tski as he drew up taking off his
cap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand 
 wasn t i telling you to fire the bridge when inflammable material
had been put in position 

 i am not your dear sir mr staff officer and you did not tell
me to burn the bridge i know the service and it is my habit orders
strictly to obey you said the bridge would be burned but who would it
burn i could not know by the holy spirit 

 ah that s always the way said nesv tski with a wave of the
hand how did you get here said he turning to zherk v 

 on the same business but you are damp let me wring you out 

 you were saying mr staff officer continued the colonel in an
offended tone 

 colonel interrupted the officer of the suite you must be
quick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot 

the colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite at the stout
staff officer and at zherk v and he frowned 

 i will the bridge fire he said in a solemn tone as if to announce
that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still
do the right thing 

striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame
for everything the colonel moved forward and ordered the second
squadron that in which rost v was serving under den sov to return to
the bridge 

 there it s just as i thought said rost v to himself he
wishes to test me his heart contracted and the blood rushed to his
face let him see whether i am a coward he thought 

again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression
appeared that they had worn when under fire rost v watched his enemy 
the colonel closely to find in his face confirmation of his own
conjecture but the colonel did not once glance at rost v and looked
as he always did when at the front solemn and stern then came the word
of command 

 look sharp look sharp several voices repeated around him 

their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling the
hussars hastily dismounted not knowing what they were to do the men
were crossing themselves rost v no longer looked at the colonel he
had no time he was afraid of falling behind the hussars so much afraid
that his heart stood still his hand trembled as he gave his horse into
an orderly s charge and he felt the blood rush to his heart with
a thud den sov rode past him leaning back and shouting something 
rost v saw nothing but the hussars running all around him their spurs
catching and their sabers clattering 

 stretchers shouted someone behind him 

rost v did not think what this call for stretchers meant he ran on 
trying only to be ahead of the others but just at the bridge not
looking at the ground he came on some sticky trodden mud stumbled 
and fell on his hands the others outstripped him 

 at boss zides captain he heard the voice of the colonel who 
having ridden ahead had pulled up his horse near the bridge with a
triumphant cheerful face 

rost v wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and
was about to run on thinking that the farther he went to the front
the better but bogd nich without looking at or recognizing rost v 
shouted to him 

 who s that running on the middle of the bridge to the right come
back cadet he cried angrily and turning to den sov who showing
off his courage had ridden on to the planks of the bridge 

 why run risks captain you should dismount he said 

 oh every bullet has its billet answered v ska den sov turning
in his saddle 


meanwhile nesv tski zherk v and the officer of the suite were
standing together out of range of the shots watching now the small
group of men with yellow shakos dark green jackets braided with cord 
and blue riding breeches who were swarming near the bridge and then at
what was approaching in the distance from the opposite side the blue
uniforms and groups with horses easily recognizable as artillery 

 will they burn the bridge or not who ll get there first will they
get there and fire the bridge or will the french get within grapeshot
range and wipe them out these were the questions each man of the
troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself
with a sinking heart watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright
evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with
their bayonets and guns 

 ugh the hussars will get it hot said nesv tski they are
within grapeshot range now 

 he shouldn t have taken so many men said the officer of the
suite 

 true enough answered nesv tski two smart fellows could have
done the job just as well 

 ah your excellency put in zherk v his eyes fixed on the
hussars but still with that na ve air that made it impossible to know
whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest ah your excellency 
how you look at things send two men and who then would give us the
vlad mir medal and ribbon but now even if they do get peppered the
squadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon our
bogd nich knows how things are done 

 there now said the officer of the suite that s
grapeshot 

he pointed to the french guns the limbers of which were being detached
and hurriedly removed 

on the french side amid the groups with cannon a cloud of smoke
appeared then a second and a third almost simultaneously and at the
moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen then two
reports one after another and a third 

 oh oh groaned nesv tski as if in fierce pain seizing the
officer of the suite by the arm look a man has fallen fallen 
fallen 

 two i think 

 if i were tsar i would never go to war said nesv tski turning
away 

the french guns were hastily reloaded the infantry in their blue
uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run smoke appeared again
but at irregular intervals and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the
bridge but this time nesv tski could not see what was happening there 
as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it the hussars had succeeded in
setting it on fire and the french batteries were now firing at them no
longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was
someone to fire at 

the french had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars
got back to their horses two were misdirected and the shot went too
high but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and
knocked three of them over 

rost v absorbed by his relations with bogd nich had paused on the
bridge not knowing what to do there was no one to hew down as he
had always imagined battles to himself nor could he help to fire the
bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the
other soldiers he stood looking about him when suddenly he heard a
rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt and the hussar nearest
to him fell against the rails with a groan rost v ran up to him with
the others again someone shouted stretchers four men seized the
hussar and began lifting him 

 oooh for christ s sake let me alone cried the wounded man but
still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher 

nicholas rost v turned away and as if searching for something gazed
into the distance at the waters of the danube at the sky and at the
sun how beautiful the sky looked how blue how calm and how deep 
how bright and glorious was the setting sun with what soft glitter the
waters of the distant danube shone and fairer still were the faraway
blue mountains beyond the river the nunnery the mysterious gorges and
the pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits there was peace
and happiness i should wish for nothing else nothing if only i
were there thought rost v in myself alone and in that sunshine
there is so much happiness but here groans suffering fear and
this uncertainty and hurry there they are shouting again and
again are all running back somewhere and i shall run with them and it 
death is here above me and around another instant and i shall never
again see the sun this water that gorge 

at that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds and other
stretchers came into view before rost v and the fear of death and of
the stretchers and love of the sun and of life all merged into one
feeling of sickening agitation 

 o lord god thou who art in that heaven save forgive and protect
me rost v whispered 

the hussars ran back to the men who held their horses their voices
sounded louder and calmer the stretchers disappeared from sight 

 well fwiend so you ve smelt powdah shouted v ska den sov
just above his ear 

 it s all over but i am a coward yes a coward thought
rost v and sighing deeply he took rook his horse which stood resting
one foot from the orderly and began to mount 

 was that grapeshot he asked den sov 

 yes and no mistake cried den sov you worked like wegular
bwicks and it s nasty work an attack s pleasant work hacking
away at the dogs but this sort of thing is the very devil with them
shooting at you like a target 

and den sov rode up to a group that had stopped near rost v composed
of the colonel nesv tski zherk v and the officer from the suite 

 well it seems that no one has noticed thought rost v and this
was true no one had taken any notice for everyone knew the sensation
which the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced 

 here s something for you to report said zherk v see if i
don t get promoted to a sublieutenancy 

 inform the prince that i the bridge fired said the colonel
triumphantly and gaily 

 and if he asks about the losses 

 a trifle said the colonel in his bass voice two hussars
wounded and one knocked out he added unable to restrain a happy
smile and pronouncing the phrase knocked out with ringing
distinctness 





chapter ix

pursued by the french army of a hundred thousand men under the command
of bonaparte encountering a population that was unfriendly to it 
losing confidence in its allies suffering from shortness of supplies 
and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had
been foreseen the russian army of thirty five thousand men commanded
by kut zov was hurriedly retreating along the danube stopping where
overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as
necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment 
there had been actions at lambach amstetten and melk but despite the
courage and endurance acknowledged even by the enemy with which the
russians fought the only consequence of these actions was a yet more
rapid retreat austrian troops that had escaped capture at ulm and had
joined kut zov at braunau now separated from the russian army and
kut zov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces the
defense of vienna was no longer to be thought of instead of an
offensive the plan of which carefully prepared in accord with the
modern science of strategics had been handed to kut zov when he was in
vienna by the austrian hofkriegsrath the sole and almost unattainable
aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were
advancing from russia without losing his army as mack had done at ulm 

on the twenty eighth of october kut zov with his army crossed to the
left bank of the danube and took up a position for the first time
with the river between himself and the main body of the french on the
thirtieth he attacked mortier s division which was on the left bank 
and broke it up in this action for the first time trophies were taken 
banners cannon and two enemy generals for the first time after a
fortnight s retreat the russian troops had halted and after a fight
had not only held the field but had repulsed the french though the
troops were ill clad exhausted and had lost a third of their number
in killed wounded sick and stragglers though a number of sick and
wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the danube with a letter
in which kut zov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy and
though the big hospitals and the houses in krems converted into military
hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded yet the
stand made at krems and the victory over mortier raised the spirits of
the army considerably throughout the whole army and at headquarters
most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach
of columns from russia of some victory gained by the austrians and of
the retreat of the frightened bonaparte 

prince andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the austrian
general schmidt who was killed in the action his horse had been
wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet as a mark
of the commander in chief s special favor he was sent with the news of
this victory to the austrian court now no longer at vienna which was
threatened by the french but at br nn despite his apparently delicate
build prince andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many
very muscular men and on the night of the battle having arrived
at krems excited but not weary with dispatches from dokht rov to
kut zov he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to br nn 
to be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step toward
promotion 

the night was dark but starry the road showed black in the snow that
had fallen the previous day the day of the battle reviewing his
impressions of the recent battle picturing pleasantly to himself the
impression his news of a victory would create or recalling the send off
given him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers prince
andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a
man who has at length begun to attain a long desired happiness as soon
as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the
wheels and the sensation of victory then he began to imagine that
the russians were running away and that he himself was killed but he
quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy as if learning afresh that
this was not so but that on the contrary the french had run away he
again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage
during the battle and feeling reassured he dozed off the dark
starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning the snow was
thawing in the sunshine the horses galloped quickly and on both sides
of the road were forests of different kinds fields and villages 

at one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of russian wounded 
the russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front
cart shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse in each of
the long german carts six or more pale dirty bandaged men were being
jolted over the stony road some of them were talking he heard russian
words others were eating bread the more severely wounded looked
silently with the languid interest of sick children at the envoy
hurrying past them 

prince andrew told his driver to stop and asked a soldier in what
action they had been wounded day before yesterday on the danube 
answered the soldier prince andrew took out his purse and gave the
soldier three gold pieces 

 that s for them all he said to the officer who came up 

 get well soon lads he continued turning to the soldiers 
 there s plenty to do still 

 what news sir asked the officer evidently anxious to start a
conversation 

 good news go on he shouted to the driver and they galloped
on 

it was already quite dark when prince andrew rattled over the paved
streets of br nn and found himself surrounded by high buildings the
lights of shops houses and street lamps fine carriages and all that
atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a
soldier after camp life despite his rapid journey and sleepless night 
prince andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and
alert than he had done the day before only his eyes gleamed feverishly
and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and
rapidity he again vividly recalled the details of the battle no longer
dim but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himself
stating them to the emperor francis he vividly imagined the casual
questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give he
expected to be at once presented to the emperor at the chief entrance
to the palace however an official came running out to meet him and
learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance 

 to the right from the corridor euer hochgeboren there you will find
the adjutant on duty said the official he will conduct you to
the minister of war 

the adjutant on duty meeting prince andrew asked him to wait and went
in to the minister of war five minutes later he returned and bowing
with particular courtesy ushered prince andrew before him along a
corridor to the cabinet where the minister of war was at work the
adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any
attempt at familiarity on the part of the russian messenger 

prince andrew s joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he
approached the door of the minister s room he felt offended and
without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into
one of disdain which was quite uncalled for his fertile mind instantly
suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise
the adjutant and the minister away from the smell of powder they
probably think it easy to gain victories he thought his eyes
narrowed disdainfully he entered the room of the minister of war with
peculiarly deliberate steps this feeling of disdain was heightened
when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers
and making pencil notes on them and for the first two or three minutes
taking no notice of his arrival a wax candle stood at each side of the
minister s bent bald head with its gray temples he went on reading
to the end without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the
sound of footsteps 

 take this and deliver it said he to his adjutant handing him the
papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger 

prince andrew felt that either the actions of kut zov s army
interested the minister of war less than any of the other matters he was
concerned with or he wanted to give the russian special messenger that
impression but that is a matter of perfect indifference to me he
thought the minister drew the remaining papers together arranged them
evenly and then raised his head he had an intellectual and distinctive
head but the instant he turned to prince andrew the firm intelligent
expression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and
habitual to him his face took on the stupid artificial smile which
does not even attempt to hide its artificiality of a man who is
continually receiving many petitioners one after another 

 from general field marshal kut zov he asked i hope it is
good news there has been an encounter with mortier a victory it was
high time 

he took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it
with a mournful expression 

 oh my god my god schmidt he exclaimed in german what a
calamity what a calamity 

having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked
at prince andrew evidently considering something 

 ah what a calamity you say the affair was decisive but mortier is
not captured again he pondered i am very glad you have brought
good news though schmidt s death is a heavy price to pay for the
victory his majesty will no doubt wish to see you but not today i
thank you you must have a rest be at the levee tomorrow after the
parade however i will let you know 

the stupid smile which had left his face while he was speaking 
reappeared 

 au revoir thank you very much his majesty will probably desire to
see you he added bowing his head 

when prince andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest
and happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the
indifferent hands of the minister of war and the polite adjutant the
whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed the battle seemed
the memory of a remote event long past 





chapter x

prince andrew stayed at br nn with bil bin a russian acquaintance of
his in the diplomatic service 

 ah my dear prince i could not have a more welcome visitor 
said bil bin as he came out to meet prince andrew franz put the
prince s things in my bedroom said he to the servant who was
ushering bolk nski in so you re a messenger of victory eh 
splendid and i am sitting here ill as you see 

after washing and dressing prince andrew came into the diplomat s
luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him bil bin
settled down comfortably beside the fire 

after his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of
all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life prince
andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such
as he had been accustomed to from childhood besides it was pleasant 
after his reception by the austrians to speak if not in russian
 for they were speaking french at least with a russian who would he
supposed share the general russian antipathy to the austrians which was
then particularly strong 

bil bin was a man of thirty five a bachelor and of the same circle as
prince andrew they had known each other previously in petersburg but
had become more intimate when prince andrew was in vienna with kut zov 
just as prince andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high
in the military profession so to an even greater extent bil bin gave
promise of rising in his diplomatic career he still a young man but
no longer a young diplomat as he had entered the service at the age
of sixteen had been in paris and copenhagen and now held a rather
important post in vienna both the foreign minister and our ambassador
in vienna knew him and valued him he was not one of those many
diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities 
avoid doing certain things and speak french he was one of those 
who liking work knew how to do it and despite his indolence would
sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table he worked well
whatever the import of his work it was not the question what for 
but the question how that interested him what the diplomatic
matter might be he did not care but it gave him great pleasure to
prepare a circular memorandum or report skillfully pointedly and
elegantly bil bin s services were valued not only for what he wrote 
but also for his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the
highest spheres 

bil bin liked conversation as he liked work only when it could be
made elegantly witty in society he always awaited an opportunity to say
something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was
possible his conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original 
finished phrases of general interest these sayings were prepared in the
inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally so
that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to
drawing room and in fact bil bin s witticisms were hawked about
in the viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters
considered important 

his thin worn sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles which always
looked as clean and well washed as the tips of one s fingers after a
russian bath the movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play
of expression on his face now his forehead would pucker into deep folds
and his eyebrows were lifted then his eyebrows would descend and
deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks his small deep set eyes always
twinkled and looked out straight 

 well now tell me about your exploits said he 

bolk nski very modestly without once mentioning himself described the
engagement and his reception by the minister of war 

 they received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of
skittles said he in conclusion 

bil bin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared 

 cependant mon cher he remarked examining his nails from a
distance and puckering the skin above his left eye malgr la haute
estime que je professe pour the orthodox russian army j avoue que
votre victoire n est pas des plus victorieuses 

 but my dear fellow with all my respect for the orthodox
 russian army i must say that your victory was not
 particularly victorious 


he went on talking in this way in french uttering only those words in
russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis 

 come now you with all your forces fall on the unfortunate mortier
and his one division and even then mortier slips through your fingers 
where s the victory 

 but seriously said prince andrew we can at any rate say
without boasting that it was a little better than at ulm 

 why didn t you capture one just one marshal for us 

 because not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness
of a parade we had expected as i told you to get at their rear by
seven in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon 

 and why didn t you do it at seven in the morning you ought to have
been there at seven in the morning returned bil bin with a smile 
 you ought to have been there at seven in the morning 

 why did you not succeed in impressing on bonaparte by diplomatic
methods that he had better leave genoa alone retorted prince andrew
in the same tone 

 i know interrupted bil bin you re thinking it s very
easy to take marshals sitting on a sofa by the fire that is true but
still why didn t you capture him so don t be surprised if not only
the minister of war but also his most august majesty the emperor and
king francis is not much delighted by your victory even i a poor
secretary of the russian embassy do not feel any need in token of my
joy to give my franz a thaler or let him go with his liebchen to the
prater true we have no prater here 

he looked straight at prince andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his
forehead 

 it is now my turn to ask you why mon cher said bolk nski 
 i confess i do not understand perhaps there are diplomatic
subtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence but i can t make it
out mack loses a whole army the archduke ferdinand and the archduke
karl give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder kut zov
alone at last gains a real victory destroying the spell of the
invincibility of the french and the minister of war does not even care
to hear the details 

 that s just it my dear fellow you see it s hurrah for the tsar 
for russia for the orthodox greek faith all that is beautiful but
what do we i mean the austrian court care for your victories bring
us nice news of a victory by the archduke karl or ferdinand one
archduke s as good as another as you know and even if it is only
over a fire brigade of bonaparte s that will be another story and
we ll fire off some cannon but this sort of thing seems done
on purpose to vex us the archduke karl does nothing the archduke
ferdinand disgraces himself you abandon vienna give up its
defense as much as to say heaven is with us but heaven help you
and your capital the one general whom we all loved schmidt you
expose to a bullet and then you congratulate us on the victory admit
that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived 
it s as if it had been done on purpose on purpose besides suppose
you did gain a brilliant victory if even the archduke karl gained a
victory what effect would that have on the general course of events 
it s too late now when vienna is occupied by the french army 

 what occupied vienna occupied 

 not only occupied but bonaparte is at sch nbrunn and the count 
our dear count vrbna goes to him for orders 

after the fatigues and impressions of the journey his reception and
especially after having dined bolk nski felt that he could not take in
the full significance of the words he heard 

 count lichtenfels was here this morning bil bin continued 
 and showed me a letter in which the parade of the french in vienna
was fully described prince murat et tout le tremblement you see that
your victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you can t be
received as a savior 

 really i don t care about that i don t care at all said
prince andrew beginning to understand that his news of the battle
before krems was really of small importance in view of such events as
the fall of austria s capital how is it vienna was taken what of
the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and prince auersperg we heard
reports that prince auersperg was defending vienna he said 

 prince auersperg is on this on our side of the river and is
defending us doing it very badly i think but still he is defending
us but vienna is on the other side no the bridge has not yet been
taken and i hope it will not be for it is mined and orders have been
given to blow it up otherwise we should long ago have been in the
mountains of bohemia and you and your army would have spent a bad
quarter of an hour between two fires 

 but still this does not mean that the campaign is over said
prince andrew 

 well i think it is the bigwigs here think so too but they
daren t say so it will be as i said at the beginning of the campaign 
it won t be your skirmishing at d rrenstein or gunpowder at all 
that will decide the matter but those who devised it said bil bin
quoting one of his own mots releasing the wrinkles on his forehead and
pausing the only question is what will come of the meeting between
the emperor alexander and the king of prussia in berlin if prussia
joins the allies austria s hand will be forced and there will be war 
if not it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of
the new campo formio are to be drawn up 

 what an extraordinary genius prince andrew suddenly exclaimed 
clenching his small hand and striking the table with it and what
luck the man has 

 buonaparte said bil bin inquiringly puckering up his forehead
to indicate that he was about to say something witty buonaparte 
he repeated accentuating the u i think however now that he lays
down laws for austria at sch nbrunn il faut lui faire gr ce de
l u i shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply
bonaparte 

 we must let him off the u 


 but joking apart said prince andrew do you really think the
campaign is over 

 this is what i think austria has been made a fool of and she is
not used to it she will retaliate and she has been fooled in the
first place because her provinces have been pillaged they say the holy
russian army loots terribly her army is destroyed her capital
taken and all this for the beaux yeux of his sardinian majesty and
therefore this is between ourselves i instinctively feel that we
are being deceived my instinct tells me of negotiations with france and
projects for peace a secret peace concluded separately 

 fine eyes 

 impossible cried prince andrew that would be too base 

 if we live we shall see replied bil bin his face again becoming
smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end 

when prince andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a
clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows he
felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far far
away from him the alliance with prussia austria s treachery 
bonaparte s new triumph tomorrow s levee and parade and the
audience with the emperor francis occupied his thoughts 

he closed his eyes and immediately a sound of cannonading of musketry
and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears and now
again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill 
the french were firing and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode
forward beside schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around 
and he experienced tenfold the joy of living as he had not done since
childhood 

he woke up 

 yes that all happened he said and smiling happily to himself
like a child he fell into a deep youthful slumber 





chapter xi

next day he woke late recalling his recent impressions the first
thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented
to the emperor francis he remembered the minister of war the polite
austrian adjutant bil bin and last night s conversation having
dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform which he
had not worn for a long time he went into bil bin s study fresh 
animated and handsome with his hand bandaged in the study were four
gentlemen of the diplomatic corps with prince hippolyte kur gin 
who was a secretary to the embassy bolk nski was already acquainted 
bil bin introduced him to the others 

the gentlemen assembled at bil bin s were young wealthy gay society
men who here as in vienna formed a special set which bil bin their
leader called les n tres this set consisting almost exclusively of
diplomats evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with
war or politics but related to high society to certain women and to
the official side of the service these gentlemen received prince
andrew as one of themselves an honor they did not extend to many from
politeness and to start conversation they asked him a few questions
about the army and the battle and then the talk went off into merry
jests and gossip 

 ours 

 but the best of it was said one telling of the misfortune of
a fellow diplomat that the chancellor told him flatly that his
appointment to london was a promotion and that he was so to regard it 
can you fancy the figure he cut 

 but the worst of it gentlemen i am giving kur gin away to
you is that that man suffers and this don juan wicked fellow is
taking advantage of it 

prince hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its
arm he began to laugh 

 tell me about that he said 

 oh you don juan you serpent cried several voices 

 you bolk nski don t know said bil bin turning to prince
andrew that all the atrocities of the french army i nearly said of
the russian army are nothing compared to what this man has been doing
among the women 

 la femme est la compagne de l homme announced prince
hippolyte and began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs 

 woman is man s companion 


bil bin and the rest of ours burst out laughing in hippolyte s
face and prince andrew saw that hippolyte of whom he had to
admit he had almost been jealous on his wife s account was the butt
of this set 

 oh i must give you a treat bil bin whispered to bolk nski 
 kur gin is exquisite when he discusses politics you should see his
gravity 

he sat down beside hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking
to him about politics prince andrew and the others gathered round these
two 

 the berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance began
hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others without
expressing as in its last note you understand besides unless
his majesty the emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance 

 wait i have not finished he said to prince andrew seizing
him by the arm i believe that intervention will be stronger than
nonintervention and he paused finally one cannot impute the
nonreceipt of our dispatch of november 18 that is how it will end 
and he released bolk nski s arm to indicate that he had now quite
finished 

 demosthenes i know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden
mouth said bil bin and the mop of hair on his head moved with
satisfaction 

everybody laughed and hippolyte louder than anyone he was evidently
distressed and breathed painfully but could not restrain the wild
laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features 

 well now gentlemen said bil bin bolk nski is my guest in
this house and in br nn itself i want to entertain him as far as i
can with all the pleasures of life here if we were in vienna it would
be easy but here in this wretched moravian hole it is more difficult 
and i beg you all to help me br nn s attractions must be shown him 
you can undertake the theater i society and you hippolyte of course
the women 

 we must let him see amelie she s exquisite said one of
 ours kissing his finger tips 

 in general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane
interests said bil bin 

 i shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality 
gentlemen it is already time for me to go replied prince andrew
looking at his watch 

 where to 

 to the emperor 

 oh oh oh 

 well au revoir bolk nski au revoir prince come back early to
dinner cried several voices we ll take you in hand 

 when speaking to the emperor try as far as you can to praise the way
that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated said bil bin 
accompanying him to the hall 

 i should like to speak well of them but as far as i know the facts 
i can t replied bolk nski smiling 

 well talk as much as you can anyway he has a passion for giving
audiences but he does not like talking himself and can t do it as
you will see 





chapter xii

at the levee prince andrew stood among the austrian officers as he had
been told to and the emperor francis merely looked fixedly into his
face and just nodded to him with his long head but after it was
over the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed
bolk nski that the emperor desired to give him an audience the emperor
francis received him standing in the middle of the room before the
conversation began prince andrew was struck by the fact that the emperor
seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say 

 tell me when did the battle begin he asked hurriedly 

prince andrew replied then followed other questions just as simple 
 was kut zov well when had he left krems and so on the emperor
spoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questions the
answers to these questions as was only too evident did not interest
him 

 at what o clock did the battle begin asked the emperor 

 i cannot inform your majesty at what o clock the battle began at
the front but at d rrenstein where i was our attack began after
five in the afternoon replied bolk nski growing more animated and
expecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account which
he had ready in his mind of all he knew and had seen but the emperor
smiled and interrupted him 

 how many miles 

 from where to where your majesty 

 from d rrenstein to krems 

 three and a half miles your majesty 

 the french have abandoned the left bank 

 according to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the
night 

 is there sufficient forage in krems 

 forage has not been supplied to the extent 

the emperor interrupted him 

 at what o clock was general schmidt killed 

 at seven o clock i believe 

 at seven o clock it s very sad very sad 

the emperor thanked prince andrew and bowed prince andrew withdrew and
was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides everywhere he
saw friendly looks and heard friendly words yesterday s adjutant
reproached him for not having stayed at the palace and offered him
his own house the minister of war came up and congratulated him on the
maria theresa order of the third grade which the emperor was conferring
on him the empress chamberlain invited him to see her majesty the
archduchess also wished to see him he did not know whom to answer and
for a few seconds collected his thoughts then the russian ambassador
took him by the shoulder led him to the window and began to talk to
him 

contrary to bil bin s forecast the news he had brought was joyfully
received a thanksgiving service was arranged kut zov was awarded
the grand cross of maria theresa and the whole army received rewards 
bolk nski was invited everywhere and had to spend the whole morning
calling on the principal austrian dignitaries between four and five
in the afternoon having made all his calls he was returning to
bil bin s house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle
and his visit to br nn at the door he found a vehicle half full of
luggage franz bil bin s man was dragging a portmanteau with some
difficulty out of the front door 

before returning to bil bin s prince andrew had gone to a bookshop
to provide himself with some books for the campaign and had spent some
time in the shop 

 what is it he asked 

 oh your excellency said franz with difficulty rolling the
portmanteau into the vehicle we are to move on still farther the
scoundrel is again at our heels 

 eh what asked prince andrew 

bil bin came out to meet him his usually calm face showed excitement 

 there now confess that this is delightful said he this
affair of the thabor bridge at vienna they have crossed without
striking a blow 

prince andrew could not understand 

 but where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the
town knows 

 i come from the archduchess i heard nothing there 

 and you didn t see that everybody is packing up 

 i did not what is it all about inquired prince andrew
impatiently 

 what s it all about why the french have crossed the bridge that
auersperg was defending and the bridge was not blown up so murat
is now rushing along the road to br nn and will be here in a day or
two 

 what here but why did they not blow up the bridge if it was
mined 

 that is what i ask you no one not even bonaparte knows why 

bolk nski shrugged his shoulders 

 but if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost it
will be cut off said he 

 that s just it answered bil bin listen the french entered
vienna as i told you very well next day which was yesterday those
gentlemen messieurs les mar chaux murat lannes and belliard 
mount and ride to the bridge observe that all three are gascons 
 gentlemen says one of them you know the thabor bridge is
mined and doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its
head and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up
the bridge and not let us cross but it will please our sovereign the
emperor napoleon if we take this bridge so let us three go and take
it yes let s say the others and off they go and take the
bridge cross it and now with their whole army are on this side of the
danube marching on us you and your lines of communication 

 the marshalls 

 stop jesting said prince andrew sadly and seriously this news
grieved him and yet he was pleased 

as soon as he learned that the russian army was in such a hopeless
situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it
out of this position that here was the toulon that would lift him from
the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame 
listening to bil bin he was already imagining how on reaching the army
he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one
that could save the army and how he alone would be entrusted with the
executing of the plan 

 stop this jesting he said 

 i am not jesting bil bin went on nothing is truer or sadder 
these gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs 
they assure the officer on duty that they the marshals are on
their way to negotiate with prince auersperg he lets them enter the
t te de pont they spin him a thousand gasconades saying that
the war is over that the emperor francis is arranging a meeting with
bonaparte that they desire to see prince auersperg and so on the
officer sends for auersperg these gentlemen embrace the officers crack
jokes sit on the cannon and meanwhile a french battalion gets to
the bridge unobserved flings the bags of incendiary material into
the water and approaches the t te de pont at length appears the
lieutenant general our dear prince auersperg von mautern himself 
 dearest foe flower of the austrian army hero of the turkish wars 
hostilities are ended we can shake one another s hand the
emperor napoleon burns with impatience to make prince auersperg s
acquaintance in a word those gentlemen gascons indeed so
bewildered him with fine words and he is so flattered by his rapidly
established intimacy with the french marshals and so dazzled by the
sight of murat s mantle and ostrich plumes qu il n y voit que du
feu et oublie celui qu il devait faire faire sur l ennemi 2 
in spite of the animation of his speech bil bin did not forget to
pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation the
french battalion rushes to the bridgehead spikes the guns and the
bridge is taken but what is best of all he went on his excitement
subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story is that the
sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire
the mines and blow up the bridge this sergeant seeing that the french
troops were running onto the bridge was about to fire but lannes
stayed his hand the sergeant who was evidently wiser than his general 
goes up to auersperg and says prince you are being deceived here
are the french murat seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is
allowed to speak turns to auersperg with feigned astonishment he is a
true gascon and says i don t recognize the world famous austrian
discipline if you allow a subordinate to address you like that it
was a stroke of genius prince auersperg feels his dignity at stake and
orders the sergeant to be arrested come you must own that this affair
of the thabor bridge is delightful it is not exactly stupidity nor
rascality 

 bridgehead 

 2 that their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that
 he ought to be firing at the enemy 

 it may be treachery said prince andrew vividly imagining the
gray overcoats wounds the smoke of gunpowder the sounds of firing 
and the glory that awaited him 

 not that either that puts the court in too bad a light replied
bil bin it s not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity it is
just as at ulm it is he seemed to be trying to find the right
expression c est c est du mack nous sommes mack s it is 
it is a bit of mack we are macked he concluded feeling that he
had produced a good epigram a fresh one that would be repeated his
hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure and with a
slight smile he began to examine his nails 

 where are you off to he said suddenly to prince andrew who had
risen and was going toward his room 

 i am going away 

 where to 

 to the army 

 but you meant to stay another two days 

 but now i am off at once 

and prince andrew after giving directions about his departure went to
his room 

 do you know mon cher said bil bin following him i have been
thinking about you why are you going 

and in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles
vanished from his face 

prince andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply 

 why are you going i know you think it your duty to gallop back to
the army now that it is in danger i understand that mon cher it is
heroism 

 not at all said prince andrew 

 but as you are a philosopher be a consistent one look at the other
side of the question and you will see that your duty on the contrary 
is to take care of yourself leave it to those who are no longer fit for
anything else you have not been ordered to return and have not been
dismissed from here therefore you can stay and go with us wherever our
ill luck takes us they say we are going to olm tz and olm tz is a
very decent town you and i will travel comfortably in my cal che 

 do stop joking bil bin cried bolk nski 

 i am speaking sincerely as a friend consider where and why are
you going when you might remain here you are faced by one of two
things and the skin over his left temple puckered either you
will not reach your regiment before peace is concluded or you will
share defeat and disgrace with kut zov s whole army 

and bil bin unwrinkled his temple feeling that the dilemma was
insoluble 

 i cannot argue about it replied prince andrew coldly but he
thought i am going to save the army 

 my dear fellow you are a hero said bil bin 





chapter xiii

that same night having taken leave of the minister of war bolk nski
set off to rejoin the army not knowing where he would find it and
fearing to be captured by the french on the way to krems 

in br nn everybody attached to the court was packing up and the heavy
baggage was already being dispatched to olm tz near hetzelsdorf prince
andrew struck the high road along which the russian army was moving with
great haste and in the greatest disorder the road was so obstructed
with carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage prince andrew
took a horse and a cossack from a cossack commander and hungry and
weary making his way past the baggage wagons rode in search of the
commander in chief and of his own luggage very sinister reports of the
position of the army reached him as he went along and the appearance of
the troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors 

 cette arm e russe que l or de l angleterre a transport e des
extr mit s de l univers nous allons lui faire prouver le m me
sort le sort de l arm e d ulm he remembered these words
in bonaparte s address to his army at the beginning of the campaign 
and they awoke in him astonishment at the genius of his hero a feeling
of wounded pride and a hope of glory and should there be nothing
left but to die he thought well if need be i shall do it no
worse than others 

 that russian army which has been brought from the ends of
 the earth by english gold we shall cause to share the same
 fate the fate of the army at ulm 


he looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments 
carts guns artillery and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all
kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road three and
sometimes four abreast from all sides behind and before as far as ear
could reach there were the rattle of wheels the creaking of carts
and gun carriages the tramp of horses the crack of whips shouts the
urging of horses and the swearing of soldiers orderlies and officers 
all along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen some
flayed some not and broken down carts beside which solitary soldiers
sat waiting for something and again soldiers straggling from their
companies crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages or
returned from them dragging sheep fowls hay and bulging sacks at
each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the
din of shouting more incessant soldiers floundering knee deep in mud
pushed the guns and wagons themselves whips cracked hoofs slipped 
traces broke and lungs were strained with shouting the officers
directing the march rode backward and forward between the carts their
voices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their faces
that they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorder 

 here is our dear orthodox russian army thought bolk nski 
recalling bil bin s words 

wishing to find out where the commander in chief was he rode up to
a convoy directly opposite to him came a strange one horse vehicle 
evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and
looking like something between a cart a cabriolet and a cal che 
a soldier was driving and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the
apron under the leather hood of the vehicle prince andrew rode up
and was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention
was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle an
officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving
the woman s vehicle for trying to get ahead of others and the strokes
of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage the woman screamed
piercingly seeing prince andrew she leaned out from behind the apron
and waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl cried 

 mr aide de camp mr aide de camp for heaven s sake protect
me what will become of us i am the wife of the doctor of the seventh
chasseurs they won t let us pass we are left behind and have lost
our people 

 i ll flatten you into a pancake shouted the angry officer to
the soldier turn back with your slut 

 mr aide de camp help me what does it all mean screamed the
doctor s wife 

 kindly let this cart pass don t you see it s a woman said
prince andrew riding up to the officer 

the officer glanced at him and without replying turned again to the
soldier i ll teach you to push on back 

 let them pass i tell you repeated prince andrew compressing his
lips 

 and who are you cried the officer turning on him with tipsy
rage who are you are you in command here eh i am commander here 
not you go back or i ll flatten you into a pancake repeated he 
this expression evidently pleased him 

 that was a nice snub for the little aide de camp came a voice
from behind 

prince andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless 
tipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying he saw that his
championship of the doctor s wife in her queer trap might expose him
to what he dreaded more than anything in the world to ridicule but
his instinct urged him on before the officer finished his sentence
prince andrew his face distorted with fury rode up to him and raised
his riding whip 

 kind ly let them pass 

the officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away 

 it s all the fault of these fellows on the staff that there s
this disorder he muttered do as you like 

prince andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the
doctor s wife who was calling him her deliverer and recalling with
a sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he
galloped on to the village where he was told that the commander in chief
was 

on reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house 
intending to rest if but for a moment eat something and try to sort
out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind this
is a mob of scoundrels and not an army he was thinking as he went
up to the window of the first house when a familiar voice called him by
name 

he turned round nesv tski s handsome face looked out of the little
window nesv tski moving his moist lips as he chewed something and
flourishing his arm called him to enter 

 bolk nski bolk nski don t you hear eh come quick he
shouted 

entering the house prince andrew saw nesv tski and another adjutant
having something to eat they hastily turned round to him asking if he
had any news on their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm 
this was particularly noticeable on nesv tski s usually laughing
countenance 

 where is the commander in chief asked bolk nski 

 here in that house answered the adjutant 

 well is it true that it s peace and capitulation asked
nesv tski 

 i was going to ask you i know nothing except that it was all i could
do to get here 

 and we my dear boy it s terrible i was wrong to laugh at mack 
we re getting it still worse said nesv tski but sit down and
have something to eat 

 you won t be able to find either your baggage or anything else now 
prince and god only knows where your man peter is said the other
adjutant 

 where are headquarters 

 we are to spend the night in znaim 

 well i have got all i need into packs for two horses said
nesv tski they ve made up splendid packs for me fit to cross
the bohemian mountains with it s a bad lookout old fellow but
what s the matter with you you must be ill to shiver like that he
added noticing that prince andrew winced as at an electric shock 

 it s nothing replied prince andrew 

he had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctor s wife and
the convoy officer 

 what is the commander in chief doing here he asked 

 i can t make out at all said nesv tski 

 well all i can make out is that everything is abominable 
abominable quite abominable said prince andrew and he went off to
the house where the commander in chief was 

passing by kut zov s carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of
his suite with their cossacks who were talking loudly together prince
andrew entered the passage kut zov himself he was told was in the
house with prince bagrati n and weyrother weyrother was the austrian
general who had succeeded schmidt in the passage little kozl vski was
squatting on his heels in front of a clerk the clerk with cuffs turned
up was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards kozl vski s
face looked worn he too had evidently not slept all night he glanced
at prince andrew and did not even nod to him 

 second line have you written it he continued dictating to the
clerk the kiev grenadiers podolian 

 one can t write so fast your honor said the clerk glancing
angrily and disrespectfully at kozl vski 

through the door came the sounds of kut zov s voice excited and
dissatisfied interrupted by another an unfamiliar voice from the
sound of these voices the inattentive way kozl vski looked at him the
disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk the fact that the clerk and
kozl vski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander
in chief and from the noisy laughter of the cossacks holding the
horses near the window prince andrew felt that something important and
disastrous was about to happen 

he turned to kozl vski with urgent questions 

 immediately prince said kozl vski dispositions for
bagrati n 

 what about capitulation 

 nothing of the sort orders are issued for a battle 

prince andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard 
just as he was going to open it the sounds ceased the door opened and
kut zov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway 
prince andrew stood right in front of kut zov but the expression of
the commander in chief s one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied
with thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence he
looked straight at his adjutant s face without recognizing him 

 well have you finished said he to kozl vski 

 one moment your excellency 

bagrati n a gaunt middle aged man of medium height with a firm 
impassive face of oriental type came out after the commander in chief 

 i have the honor to present myself repeated prince andrew rather
loudly handing kut zov an envelope 

 ah from vienna very good later later 

kut zov went out into the porch with bagrati n 

 well good by prince said he to bagrati n my blessing and
may christ be with you in your great endeavor 

his face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes with his left
hand he drew bagrati n toward him and with his right on which he wore
a ring he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently
habitual offering his puffy cheek but bagrati n kissed him on the
neck instead 

 christ be with you kut zov repeated and went toward his
carriage get in with me said he to bolk nski 

 your excellency i should like to be of use here allow me to remain
with prince bagrati n s detachment 

 get in said kut zov and noticing that bolk nski still delayed 
he added i need good officers myself need them myself 

they got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence 

 there is still much much before us he said as if with an old
man s penetration he understood all that was passing in bolk nski s
mind if a tenth part of his detachment returns i shall thank god 
he added as if speaking to himself 

prince andrew glanced at kut zov s face only a foot distant from him
and involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near
his temple where an ismail bullet had pierced his skull and the empty
eye socket yes he has a right to speak so calmly of those men s
death thought bolk nski 

 that is why i beg to be sent to that detachment he said 

kut zov did not reply he seemed to have forgotten what he had been
saying and sat plunged in thought five minutes later gently swaying
on the soft springs of the carriage he turned to prince andrew 
there was not a trace of agitation on his face with delicate irony he
questioned prince andrew about the details of his interview with the
emperor about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the krems
affair and about some ladies they both knew 





chapter xiv

on november 1 kut zov had received through a spy news that the army
he commanded was in an almost hopeless position the spy reported that
the french after crossing the bridge at vienna were advancing in
immense force upon kut zov s line of communication with the troops
that were arriving from russia if kut zov decided to remain at krems 
napoleon s army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him
off completely and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand and he
would find himself in the position of mack at ulm if kut zov decided
to abandon the road connecting him with the troops arriving from russia 
he would have to march with no road into unknown parts of the bohemian
mountains defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and
abandoning all hope of a junction with buxh wden if kut zov decided
to retreat along the road from krems to olm tz to unite with the
troops arriving from russia he risked being forestalled on that road
by the french who had crossed the vienna bridge and encumbered by his
baggage and transport having to accept battle on the march against an
enemy three times as strong who would hem him in from two sides 

kut zov chose this latter course 

the french the spy reported having crossed the vienna bridge were
advancing by forced marches toward znaim which lay sixty six miles
off on the line of kut zov s retreat if he reached znaim before the
french there would be great hope of saving the army to let the
french forestall him at znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a
disgrace such as that of ulm or to utter destruction but to forestall
the french with his whole army was impossible the road for the french
from vienna to znaim was shorter and better than the road for the
russians from krems to znaim 

the night he received the news kut zov sent bagrati n s vanguard 
four thousand strong to the right across the hills from the krems znaim
to the vienna znaim road bagrati n was to make this march without
resting and to halt facing vienna with znaim to his rear and if he
succeeded in forestalling the french he was to delay them as long as
possible kut zov himself with all his transport took the road to
znaim 

marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills with his
hungry ill shod soldiers and losing a third of his men as stragglers
by the way bagrati n came out on the vienna znaim road at hollabr nn
a few hours ahead of the french who were approaching hollabr nn from
vienna kut zov with his transport had still to march for some days
before he could reach znaim hence bagrati n with his four thousand
hungry exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army
that came upon him at hollabr nn which was clearly impossible but
a freak of fate made the impossible possible the success of the trick
that had placed the vienna bridge in the hands of the french without
a fight led murat to try to deceive kut zov in a similar way meeting
bagrati n s weak detachment on the znaim road he supposed it to be
kut zov s whole army to be able to crush it absolutely he awaited
the arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from vienna 
and with this object offered a three days truce on condition that
both armies should remain in position without moving murat declared
that negotiations for peace were already proceeding and that he
therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed count
nostitz the austrian general occupying the advanced posts believed
murat s emissary and retired leaving bagrati n s division
exposed another emissary rode to the russian line to announce the peace
negotiations and to offer the russian army the three days truce 
bagrati n replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse
a truce and sent his adjutant to kut zov to report the offer he had
received 

a truce was kut zov s sole chance of gaining time giving
bagrati n s exhausted troops some rest and letting the transport and
heavy convoys whose movements were concealed from the french advance
if but one stage nearer znaim the offer of a truce gave the only and
a quite unexpected chance of saving the army on receiving the news
he immediately dispatched adjutant general wintzingerode who was in
attendance on him to the enemy camp wintzingerode was not merely
to agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation and
meanwhile kut zov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the
movements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the krems znaim
road bagrati n s exhausted and hungry detachment which alone
covered this movement of the transport and of the whole army had to
remain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself 

kut zov s expectations that the proposals of capitulation which were
in no way binding might give time for part of the transport to pass 
and also that murat s mistake would very soon be discovered proved
correct as soon as bonaparte who was at sch nbrunn sixteen miles
from hollabr nn received murat s dispatch with the proposal of a
truce and a capitulation he detected a ruse and wrote the following
letter to murat 

sch nbrunn 25th brumaire 1805 

at eight o clock in the morning

to prince murat 

i cannot find words to express to you my displeasure you command only
my advance guard and have no right to arrange an armistice without my
order you are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign break
the armistice immediately and march on the enemy inform him that the
general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so and that no
one but the emperor of russia has that right 

if however the emperor of russia ratifies that convention i will
ratify it but it is only a trick march on destroy the russian
army you are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery 

the russian emperor s aide de camp is an impostor officers are
nothing when they have no powers this one had none the austrians
let themselves be tricked at the crossing of the vienna bridge you are
letting yourself be tricked by an aide de camp of the emperor 

napoleon

bonaparte s adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to
murat bonaparte himself not trusting to his generals moved with all
the guards to the field of battle afraid of letting a ready victim
escape and bagrati n s four thousand men merrily lighted campfires 
dried and warmed themselves cooked their porridge for the first time
for three days and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store
for him 





chapter xv

between three and four o clock in the afternoon prince andrew who
had persisted in his request to kut zov arrived at grunth and reported
himself to bagrati n bonaparte s adjutant had not yet reached
murat s detachment and the battle had not yet begun in bagrati n s
detachment no one knew anything of the general position of affairs they
talked of peace but did not believe in its possibility others talked
of a battle but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement 
bagrati n knowing bolk nski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant 
received him with distinction and special marks of favor explaining to
him that there would probably be an engagement that day or the next and
giving him full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join
the rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat which is also
very important 

 however there will hardly be an engagement today said bagrati n
as if to reassure prince andrew 

 if he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a
medal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard but if he
wishes to stay with me let him he ll be of use here if he s a
brave officer thought bagrati n prince andrew without replying 
asked the prince s permission to ride round the position to see the
disposition of the forces so as to know his bearings should he be sent
to execute an order the officer on duty a handsome elegantly dressed
man with a diamond ring on his forefinger who was fond of speaking
french though he spoke it badly offered to conduct prince andrew 

on all sides they saw rain soaked officers with dejected faces who
seemed to be seeking something and soldiers dragging doors benches 
and fencing from the village 

 there now prince we can t stop those fellows said the staff
officer pointing to the soldiers the officers don t keep them in
hand and there he pointed to a sutler s tent they crowd in
and sit this morning i turned them all out and now look it s full
again i must go there prince and scare them a bit it won t take a
moment 

 yes let s go in and i will get myself a roll and some cheese 
said prince andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything 

 why didn t you mention it prince i would have offered you
something 

they dismounted and entered the tent several officers with flushed and
weary faces were sitting at the table eating and drinking 

 now what does this mean gentlemen said the staff officer in
the reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more
than once you know it won t do to leave your posts like this 
the prince gave orders that no one should leave his post now you 
captain and he turned to a thin dirty little artillery officer who
without his boots he had given them to the canteen keeper to dry 
in only his stockings rose when they entered smiling not altogether
comfortably 

 well aren t you ashamed of yourself captain t shin he
continued one would think that as an artillery officer you would set
a good example yet here you are without your boots the alarm will be
sounded and you ll be in a pretty position without your boots the
staff officer smiled kindly return to your posts gentlemen all of
you all he added in a tone of command 

prince andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officer
t shin who silent and smiling shifting from one stockinged foot to
the other glanced inquiringly with his large intelligent kindly eyes
from prince andrew to the staff officer 

 the soldiers say it feels easier without boots said captain
t shin smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position evidently wishing
to adopt a jocular tone but before he had finished he felt that his
jest was unacceptable and had not come off he grew confused 

 kindly return to your posts said the staff officer trying to
preserve his gravity 

prince andrew glanced again at the artillery officer s small figure 
there was something peculiar about it quite unsoldierly rather comic 
but extremely attractive 

the staff officer and prince andrew mounted their horses and rode on 

having ridden beyond the village continually meeting and overtaking
soldiers and officers of various regiments they saw on their left some
entrenchments being thrown up the freshly dug clay of which showed up
red several battalions of soldiers in their shirt sleeves despite
the cold wind swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants 
spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the
bank by unseen hands prince andrew and the officer rode up looked at
the entrenchment and went on again just behind it they came upon some
dozens of soldiers continually replaced by others who ran from the
entrenchment they had to hold their noses and put their horses to a
trot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines 

 voil l agr ment des camps monsieur le prince said the
staff officer 

 this is a pleasure one gets in camp prince 


they rode up the opposite hill from there the french could already be
seen prince andrew stopped and began examining the position 

 that s our battery said the staff officer indicating the
highest point it s in charge of the queer fellow we saw without
his boots you can see everything from there let s go there 
prince 

 thank you very much i will go on alone said prince andrew 
wishing to rid himself of this staff officer s company please
don t trouble yourself further 

the staff officer remained behind and prince andrew rode on alone 

the farther forward and nearer the enemy he went the more orderly and
cheerful were the troops the greatest disorder and depression had been
in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the znaim road seven
miles away from the french at grunth also some apprehension and alarm
could be felt but the nearer prince andrew came to the french lines the
more confident was the appearance of our troops the soldiers in
their greatcoats were ranged in lines the sergeants major and company
officers were counting the men poking the last man in each section in
the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up soldiers scattered over
the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were building
shelters with merry chatter and laughter around the fires sat others 
dressed and undressed drying their shirts and leg bands or mending
boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers 
in one company dinner was ready and the soldiers were gazing eagerly
at the steaming boiler waiting till the sample which a quartermaster
sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log
before his shelter had been tasted 

another company a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka 
crowded round a pockmarked broad shouldered sergeant major who tilting
a keg filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him the
soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential faces 
emptied them rolling the vodka in their mouths and walked away from
the sergeant major with brightened expressions licking their lips and
wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats all their faces were
as serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful
encampment and not within sight of the enemy before an action in
which at least half of them would be left on the field after passing a
chasseur regiment and in the lines of the kiev grenadiers fine fellows
busy with similar peaceful affairs near the shelter of the regimental
commander higher than and different from the others prince andrew came
out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man two
soldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches and
striking him regularly on his bare back the man shrieked unnaturally 
a stout major was pacing up and down the line and regardless of the
screams kept repeating 

 it s a shame for a soldier to steal a soldier must be honest 
honorable and brave but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in
him he s a scoundrel go on go on 

so the swishing sound of the strokes and the desperate but unnatural
screams continued 

 go on go on said the major 

a young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face
stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant
as he rode by 

prince andrew having reached the front line rode along it our front
line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks 
but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that
morning the lines were so near together that the men could see one
another s faces and speak to one another besides the soldiers who
formed the picket line on either side there were many curious onlookers
who jesting and laughing stared at their strange foreign enemies 

since early morning despite an injunction not to approach the picket
line the officers had been unable to keep sight seers away the
soldiers forming the picket line like showmen exhibiting a curiosity 
no longer looked at the french but paid attention to the sight seers and
grew weary waiting to be relieved prince andrew halted to have a look
at the french 

 look look there one soldier was saying to another pointing to a
russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and
was rapidly and excitedly talking to a french grenadier hark to him
jabbering fine isn t it it s all the frenchy can do to keep up
with him there now s dorov 

 wait a bit and listen it s fine answered s dorov who was
considered an adept at french 

the soldier to whom the laughers referred was d lokhov prince andrew
recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying d lokhov
had come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed with
his captain 

 now then go on go on incited the officer bending forward and
trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to
him more please more what s he saying 

d lokhov did not answer the captain he had been drawn into a hot
dispute with the french grenadier they were naturally talking about the
campaign the frenchman confusing the austrians with the russians was
trying to prove that the russians had surrendered and had fled all
the way from ulm while d lokhov maintained that the russians had not
surrendered but had beaten the french 

 we have orders to drive you off here and we shall drive you off 
said d lokhov 

 only take care you and your cossacks are not all captured said
the french grenadier 

the french onlookers and listeners laughed 

 we ll make you dance as we did under suv rov said
d lokhov 

 on vous fera danser 


 qu est ce qu il chante asked a frenchman 

 what s he singing about 


 it s ancient history said another guessing that it referred to
a former war the emperor will teach your suvara as he has taught the
others 

 bonaparte began d lokhov but the frenchman interrupted him 

 not bonaparte he is the emperor sacr nom cried he angrily 

 the devil skin your emperor 

and d lokhov swore at him in coarse soldier s russian and shouldering
his musket walked away 

 let us go iv n luk ch he said to the captain 

 ah that s the way to talk french said the picket soldiers 
 now s dorov you have a try 

s dorov turning to the french winked and began to jabber meaningless
sounds very fast kari mala tafa safi muter kask he said 
trying to give an expressive intonation to his voice 

 ho ho ho ha ha ha ha ouh ouh came peals of such healthy
and good humored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the french
involuntarily so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be
to unload the muskets explode the ammunition and all return home as
quickly as possible 

but the guns remained loaded the loopholes in blockhouses and
entrenchments looked out just as menacingly and the unlimbered cannon
confronted one another as before 





chapter xvi

having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left prince
andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had
told him the whole field could be seen here he dismounted and stopped
beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon before the guns an
artillery sentry was pacing up and down he stood at attention when the
officer arrived but at a sign resumed his measured monotonous pacing 
behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes
and artillerymen s bonfires to the left not far from the farthest
cannon was a small newly constructed wattle shed from which came the
sound of officers voices in eager conversation 

it was true that a view over nearly the whole russian position and the
greater part of the enemy s opened out from this battery just facing
it on the crest of the opposite hill the village of sch n grabern
could be seen and in three places to left and right the french troops
amid the smoke of their campfires the greater part of whom were
evidently in the village itself and behind the hill to the left from
that village amid the smoke was something resembling a battery but it
was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye our right flank was
posted on a rather steep incline which dominated the french position 
our infantry were stationed there and at the farthest point the
dragoons in the center where t shin s battery stood and from which
prince andrew was surveying the position was the easiest and most
direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from sch n
grabern on the left our troops were close to a copse in which smoked
the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood the french line was
wider than ours and it was plain that they could easily outflank us
on both sides behind our position was a steep and deep dip making it
difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire prince andrew took
out his notebook and leaning on the cannon sketched a plan of the
position he made some notes on two points intending to mention them to
bagrati n his idea was first to concentrate all the artillery in the
center and secondly to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the
dip prince andrew being always near the commander in chief closely
following the mass movements and general orders and constantly studying
historical accounts of battles involuntarily pictured to himself the
course of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline he
imagined only important possibilities if the enemy attacks the right
flank he said to himself the kiev grenadiers and the pod lsk
chasseurs must hold their position till reserves from the center
come up in that case the dragoons could successfully make a flank
counterattack if they attack our center we having the center battery
on this high ground shall withdraw the left flank under its cover and
retreat to the dip by echelons so he reasoned all the time
he had been beside the gun he had heard the voices of the officers
distinctly but as often happens had not understood a word of what they
were saying suddenly however he was struck by a voice coming from the
shed and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen 

 no friend said a pleasant and as it seemed to prince andrew a
familiar voice what i say is that if it were possible to know
what is beyond death none of us would be afraid of it that s so 
friend 

another a younger voice interrupted him afraid or not you can t
escape it anyhow 

 all the same one is afraid oh you clever people said a third
manly voice interrupting them both of course you artillery men are
very wise because you can take everything along with you vodka and
snacks 

and the owner of the manly voice evidently an infantry officer 
laughed 

 yes one is afraid continued the first speaker he of the
familiar voice one is afraid of the unknown that s what it is 
whatever we may say about the soul going to the sky we know there is
no sky but only an atmosphere 

the manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer 

 well stand us some of your herb vodka t shin it said 

 why thought prince andrew that s the captain who stood up
in the sutler s hut without his boots he recognized the agreeable 
philosophizing voice with pleasure 

 some herb vodka certainly said t shin but still to
conceive a future life 

he did not finish just then there was a whistle in the air nearer and
nearer faster and louder louder and faster a cannon ball as if it
had not finished saying what was necessary thudded into the ground near
the shed with super human force throwing up a mass of earth the ground
seemed to groan at the terrible impact 

and immediately t shin with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth
and his kind intelligent face rather pale rushed out of the shed
followed by the owner of the manly voice a dashing infantry officer who
hurried off to his company buttoning up his coat as he ran 





chapter xvii

mounting his horse again prince andrew lingered with the battery 
looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball his eyes
ran rapidly over the wide space but he only saw that the hitherto
motionless masses of the french now swayed and that there really was
a battery to their left the smoke above it had not yet dispersed two
mounted frenchmen probably adjutants were galloping up the hill a
small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill 
probably to strengthen the front line the smoke of the first shot had
not yet dispersed before another puff appeared followed by a report 
the battle had begun prince andrew turned his horse and galloped back
to grunth to find prince bagrati n he heard the cannonade behind him
growing louder and more frequent evidently our guns had begun to reply 
from the bottom of the slope where the parleys had taken place came
the report of musketry 

lemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with bonaparte s stern letter 
and murat humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault had at once
moved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the russian
wings hoping before evening and before the arrival of the emperor to
crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him 

 it has begun here it is thought prince andrew feeling the
blood rush to his heart but where and how will my toulon present
itself 

passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking
vodka a quarter of an hour before he saw everywhere the same rapid
movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready 
and on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his
heart it has begun here it is dreadful but enjoyable was what
the face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say 

before he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up he saw 
in the light of the dull autumn evening mounted men coming toward him 
the foremost wearing a cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a
white horse was prince bagrati n prince andrew stopped waiting for
him to come up prince bagrati n reined in his horse and recognizing
prince andrew nodded to him he still looked ahead while prince andrew
told him what he had seen 

the feeling it has begun here it is was seen even on prince
bagrati n s hard brown face with its half closed dull sleepy eyes 
prince andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face
and wished he could tell what if anything this man was thinking
and feeling at that moment is there anything at all behind that
impassive face prince andrew asked himself as he looked prince
bagrati n bent his head in sign of agreement with what prince andrew
told him and said very good in a tone that seemed to imply that
everything that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he
had foreseen prince andrew out of breath with his rapid ride spoke
quickly prince bagrati n uttering his words with an oriental accent 
spoke particularly slowly as if to impress the fact that there was no
need to hurry however he put his horse to a trot in the direction
of t shin s battery prince andrew followed with the suite behind
prince bagrati n rode an officer of the suite the prince s personal
adjutant zherk v an orderly officer the staff officer on duty 
riding a fine bobtailed horse and a civilian an accountant who had
asked permission to be present at the battle out of curiosity the
accountant a stout full faced man looked around him with a na ve
smile of satisfaction and presented a strange appearance among the
hussars cossacks and adjutants in his camlet coat as he jolted on
his horse with a convoy officer s saddle 

 he wants to see a battle said zherk v to bolk nski pointing
to the accountant but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach
already 

 oh leave off said the accountant with a beaming but rather
cunning smile as if flattered at being made the subject of zherk v s
joke and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was 

 it is very strange mon monsieur prince said the staff officer 
 he remembered that in french there is some peculiar way of addressing a
prince but could not get it quite right 

by this time they were all approaching t shin s battery and a ball
struck the ground in front of them 

 what s that that has fallen asked the accountant with a na ve
smile 

 a french pancake answered zherk v 

 so that s what they hit with asked the accountant how
awful 

he seemed to swell with satisfaction he had hardly finished speaking
when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenly
ended with a thud into something soft f f flop and a cossack riding
a little to their right and behind the accountant crashed to earth with
his horse zherk v and the staff officer bent over their saddles and
turned their horses away the accountant stopped facing the cossack 
and examined him with attentive curiosity the cossack was dead but the
horse still struggled 

prince bagrati n screwed up his eyes looked round and seeing the
cause of the confusion turned away with indifference as if to say 
 is it worth while noticing trifles he reined in his horse with
the care of a skillful rider and slightly bending over disengaged his
saber which had caught in his cloak it was an old fashioned saber of
a kind no longer in general use prince andrew remembered the story of
suv rov giving his saber to bagrati n in italy and the recollection
was particularly pleasant at that moment they had reached the battery
at which prince andrew had been when he examined the battlefield 

 whose company asked prince bagrati n of an artilleryman standing
by the ammunition wagon 

he asked whose company but he really meant are you
frightened here and the artilleryman understood him 

 captain t shin s your excellency shouted the red haired 
freckled gunner in a merry voice standing to attention 

 yes yes muttered bagrati n as if considering something and he
rode past the limbers to the farthest cannon 

as he approached a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his
suite and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see
the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its
former position a huge broad shouldered gunner number one holding
a mop his legs far apart sprang to the wheel while number two with
a trembling hand placed a charge in the cannon s mouth the short 
round shouldered captain t shin stumbling over the tail of the gun
carriage moved forward and not noticing the general looked out
shading his eyes with his small hand 

 lift it two lines more and it will be just right cried he in a
feeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note ill suited to
his weak figure number two he squeaked fire medv dev 

bagrati n called to him and t shin raising three fingers to his cap
with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute
but like a priest s benediction approached the general though
t shin s guns had been intended to cannonade the valley he was
firing incendiary balls at the village of sch n grabern visible just
opposite in front of which large masses of french were advancing 

no one had given t shin orders where and at what to fire but after
consulting his sergeant major zakharch nko for whom he had great
respect he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the
village very good said bagrati n in reply to the officer s
report and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended
before him the french had advanced nearest on our right below the
height on which the kiev regiment was stationed in the hollow where the
rivulet flowed the soul stirring rolling and crackling of musketry was
heard and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons the officer of
the suite pointed out to bagrati n a french column that was outflanking
us to the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood prince
bagrati n ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to
reinforce the right flank the officer of the suite ventured to remark
to the prince that if these battalions went away the guns would remain
without support prince bagrati n turned to the officer and with his
dull eyes looked at him in silence it seemed to prince andrew that the
officer s remark was just and that really no answer could be made to
it but at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the
commander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses
of the french were coming down upon them and that his regiment was in
disorder and was retreating upon the kiev grenadiers prince bagrati n
bowed his head in sign of assent and approval he rode off at a walk to
the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the
french but this adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that
the commander of the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in
the ground as a heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing
men uselessly and so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the
wood 

 very good said bagrati n 

as he was leaving the battery firing was heard on the left also and
as it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there
himself prince bagrati n sent zherk v to tell the general in command
 the one who had paraded his regiment before kut zov at braunau that
he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear 
as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemy s
attack very long about t shin and the battalion that had been in
support of his battery all was forgotten prince andrew listened
attentively to bagrati n s colloquies with the commanding officers
and the orders he gave them and to his surprise found that no orders
were really given but that prince bagrati n tried to make it appear
that everything done by necessity by accident or by the will of
subordinate commanders was done if not by his direct command at least
in accord with his intentions prince andrew noticed however that
though what happened was due to chance and was independent of the
commander s will owing to the tact bagrati n showed his presence
was very valuable officers who approached him with disturbed
countenances became calm soldiers and officers greeted him gaily grew
more cheerful in his presence and were evidently anxious to display
their courage before him 





chapter xviii

prince bagrati n having reached the highest point of our right flank 
began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where
on account of the smoke nothing could be seen the nearer they got to
the hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness
of the actual battlefield they began to meet wounded men one with a
bleeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who
supported him under the arms there was a gurgle in his throat and he
was spitting blood a bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or
mouth another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket 
groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt while
blood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle he had
that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering 
crossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men
lying on the ground they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were
unwounded the soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily and
despite the general s presence were talking loudly and gesticulating 
in front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the
smoke and an officer catching sight of bagrati n rushed shouting after
the crowd of retreating soldiers ordering them back bagrati n rode up
to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there drowning
the sound of voices and the shouts of command the whole air reeked with
smoke the excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it some
were using their ramrods others putting powder on the touchpans or
taking charges from their pouches while others were firing though who
they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no
wind to carry away a pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were
often heard what is this thought prince andrew approaching the
crowd of soldiers it can t be an attack for they are not moving 
it can t be a square for they are not drawn up for that 

the commander of the regiment a thin feeble looking old man with a
pleasant smile his eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes 
giving him a mild expression rode up to bagrati n and welcomed him as
a host welcomes an honored guest he reported that his regiment had
been attacked by french cavalry and that though the attack had been
repulsed he had lost more than half his men he said the attack
had been repulsed employing this military term to describe what had
occurred to his regiment but in reality he did not himself know what
had happened during that half hour to the troops entrusted to him and
could not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his
regiment had been broken up all he knew was that at the commencement
of the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and
hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted cavalry and
our men had begun firing they were still firing not at the cavalry
which had disappeared but at french infantry who had come into the
hollow and were firing at our men prince bagrati n bowed his head as a
sign that this was exactly what he had desired and expected turning
to his adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the
sixth chasseurs whom they had just passed prince andrew was struck by
the changed expression on prince bagrati n s face at this moment it
expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of
a man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water 
the dull sleepy expression was no longer there nor the affectation
of profound thought the round steady hawk s eyes looked before him
eagerly and rather disdainfully not resting on anything although his
movements were still slow and measured 

the commander of the regiment turned to prince bagrati n entreating
him to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were 
 please your excellency for god s sake he kept saying 
glancing for support at an officer of the suite who turned away
from him there you see and he drew attention to the bullets
whistling singing and hissing continually around them he spoke in the
tone of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who
has picked up an ax we are used to it but you sir will blister
your hands he spoke as if those bullets could not kill him and his
half closed eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his words the staff
officer joined in the colonel s appeals but bagrati n did not reply 
he only gave an order to cease firing and re form so as to give room
for the two approaching battalions while he was speaking the curtain
of smoke that had concealed the hollow driven by a rising wind began
to move from right to left as if drawn by an invisible hand and the
hill opposite with the french moving about on it opened out before
them all eyes fastened involuntarily on this french column advancing
against them and winding down over the uneven ground one could already
see the soldiers shaggy caps distinguish the officers from the men 
and see the standard flapping against its staff 

 they march splendidly remarked someone in bagrati n s suite 

the head of the column had already descended into the hollow the clash
would take place on this side of it 

the remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up
and moved to the right from behind it dispersing the laggards came
two battalions of the sixth chasseurs in fine order before they had
reached bagrati n the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in
step could be heard on their left flank nearest to bagrati n marched
a company commander a fine round faced man with a stupid and happy
expression the same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed at that
moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he
would appear as he passed the commander 

with the self satisfaction of a man on parade he stepped lightly with
his muscular legs as if sailing along stretching himself to his full
height without the smallest effort his ease contrasting with the heavy
tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him he carried close
to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword small curved and not like a real
weapon and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the men
without losing step his whole powerful body turning flexibly it was as
if all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander
in the best possible manner and feeling that he was doing it well he
was happy left left left he seemed to repeat to himself
at each alternate step and in time to this with stern but varied
faces the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched
in step and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be
repeating to himself at each alternate step left left 
left a fat major skirted a bush puffing and falling out of
step a soldier who had fallen behind his face showing alarm at his
defection ran at a trot panting to catch up with his company a cannon
ball cleaving the air flew over the heads of bagrati n and his suite 
and fell into the column to the measure of left left close
up came the company commander s voice in jaunty tones the
soldiers passed in a semicircle round something where the ball had
fallen and an old trooper on the flank a noncommissioned officer who
had stopped beside the dead men ran to catch up his line and falling
into step with a hop looked back angrily and through the ominous
silence and the regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison one
seemed to hear left left left 

 well done lads said prince bagrati n 

 glad to do our best your ex len lency came a confused shout
from the ranks a morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on
bagrati n as he shouted with an expression that seemed to say we
know that ourselves another without looking round as though
fearing to relax shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on 

the order was given to halt and down knapsacks 

bagrati n rode round the ranks that had marched past him and
dismounted he gave the reins to a cossack took off and handed over his
felt coat stretched his legs and set his cap straight the head of the
french column with its officers leading appeared from below the hill 

 forward with god said bagrati n in a resolute sonorous voice 
turning for a moment to the front line and slightly swinging his arms 
he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of
a cavalryman prince andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him
forward and experienced great happiness 

the french were already near prince andrew walking beside bagrati n 
could clearly distinguish their bandoliers red epaulets and even their
faces he distinctly saw an old french officer who with gaitered
legs and turned out toes climbed the hill with difficulty prince
bagrati n gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in
front of the ranks suddenly one shot after another rang out from the
french smoke appeared all along their uneven ranks and musket shots
sounded several of our men fell among them the round faced officer
who had marched so gaily and complacently but at the moment the first
report was heard bagrati n looked round and shouted hurrah 

 hurrah ah ah rang a long drawn shout from our ranks and
passing bagrati n and racing one another they rushed in an irregular
but joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe 





chapter xix

the attack of the sixth chasseurs secured the retreat of our right
flank in the center t shin s forgotten battery which had managed to
set fire to the sch n grabern village delayed the french advance the
french were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading and thus
gave us time to retreat the retirement of the center to the other side
of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy but the
different companies did not get mixed but our left which consisted
of the az v and pod lsk infantry and the p vlograd hussars was
simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior french forces under
lannes and was thrown into confusion bagrati n had sent zherk v
to the general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat
immediately 

zherk v not removing his hand from his cap turned his horse about
and galloped off but no sooner had he left bagrati n than his courage
failed him he was seized by panic and could not go where it was
dangerous 

having reached the left flank instead of going to the front where the
firing was he began to look for the general and his staff where they
could not possibly be and so did not deliver the order 

the command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of
the regiment kut zov had reviewed at braunau and in which d lokhov was
serving as a private but the command of the extreme left flank had been
assigned to the commander of the p vlograd regiment in which rost v
was serving and a misunderstanding arose the two commanders were much
exasperated with one another and long after the action had begun on
the right flank and the french were already advancing were engaged
in discussion with the sole object of offending one another but the
regiments both cavalry and infantry were by no means ready for the
impending action from privates to general they were not expecting a
battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations the cavalry feeding the
horses and the infantry collecting wood 

 he higher iss dan i in rank said the german colonel of the
hussars flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up so
let him do what he vill but i cannot sacrifice my hussars bugler 
sount ze retreat 

but haste was becoming imperative cannon and musketry mingling
together thundered on the right and in the center while the capotes
of lannes sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and
forming up within twice the range of a musket shot the general in
command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps and
having mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the
p vlograd commander the commanders met with polite bows but with
secret malevolence in their hearts 

 once again colonel said the general i can t leave half
my men in the wood i beg of you i beg of you he repeated to
occupy the position and prepare for an attack 

 i peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business 
suddenly replied the irate colonel if you vere in the cavalry 

 i am not in the cavalry colonel but i am a russian general and if
you are not aware of the fact 

 quite avare your excellency suddenly shouted the colonel 
touching his horse and turning purple in the face vill you be so
goot to come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot i don t
vish to destroy my men for your pleasure 

 you forget yourself colonel i am not considering my own pleasure
and i won t allow it to be said 

taking the colonel s outburst as a challenge to his courage the
general expanded his chest and rode frowning beside him to the
front line as if their differences would be settled there amongst the
bullets they reached the front several bullets sped over them and
they halted in silence there was nothing fresh to be seen from the
line for from where they had been before it had been evident that it
was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground 
as well as that the french were outflanking our left the general
and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another like two
fighting cocks preparing for battle each vainly trying to detect signs
of cowardice in the other both passed the examination successfully as
there was nothing to be said and neither wished to give occasion for
it to be alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire 
they would have remained there for a long time testing each other s
courage had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry
and a muffled shout almost behind them in the wood the french had
attacked the men collecting wood in the copse it was no longer possible
for the hussars to retreat with the infantry they were cut off from
the line of retreat on the left by the french however inconvenient the
position it was now necessary to attack in order to cut a way through
for themselves 

the squadron in which rost v was serving had scarcely time to mount
before it was halted facing the enemy again as at the enns bridge 
there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy and again that
terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fear resembling the line
separating the living from the dead lay between them all were
conscious of this unseen line and the question whether they would cross
it or not and how they would cross it agitated them all 

the colonel rode to the front angrily gave some reply to questions put
to him by the officers and like a man desperately insisting on having
his own way gave an order no one said anything definite but the rumor
of an attack spread through the squadron the command to form up rang
out and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards 
still no one moved the troops of the left flank infantry and hussars
alike felt that the commander did not himself know what to do and this
irresolution communicated itself to the men 

 if only they would be quick thought rost v feeling that at last
the time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so
often heard from his fellow hussars 

 fo ward with god lads rang out den sov s voice at a
twot fo ward 

the horses croups began to sway in the front line rook pulled at the
reins and started of his own accord 

before him on the right rost v saw the front lines of his hussars and
still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but
took to be the enemy shots could be heard but some way off 

 faster came the word of command and rost v felt rook s flanks
drooping as he broke into a gallop 

rost v anticipated his horse s movements and became more and more
elated he had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him this tree had been
in the middle of the line that had seemed so terrible and now he
had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible but
everything was becoming more and more happy and animated oh how i
will slash at him thought rost v gripping the hilt of his saber 

 hur a a a ah came a roar of voices let anyone come my way
now thought rost v driving his spurs into rook and letting him go
at a full gallop so that he outstripped the others ahead the enemy was
already visible suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep
over the squadron rost v raised his saber ready to strike but at
that instant the trooper nik tenko who was galloping ahead shot away
from him and rost v felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried
forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot from
behind him bondarch k an hussar he knew jolted against him and looked
angrily at him bondarch k s horse swerved and galloped past 

 how is it i am not moving i have fallen i am killed rost v
asked and answered at the same instant he was alone in the middle of a
field instead of the moving horses and hussars backs he saw nothing
before him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him there
was warm blood under his arm no i am wounded and the horse is
killed rook tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back pinning his
rider s leg blood was flowing from his head he struggled but could
not rise rost v also tried to rise but fell back his sabretache
having become entangled in the saddle where our men were and where the
french he did not know there was no one near 

having disentangled his leg he rose where on which side was now
the line that had so sharply divided the two armies he asked himself
and could not answer can something bad have happened to me 
he wondered as he got up and at that moment he felt that something
superfluous was hanging on his benumbed left arm the wrist felt as if
it were not his he examined his hand carefully vainly trying to find
blood on it ah here are people coming he thought joyfully 
seeing some men running toward him they will help me in front
came a man wearing a strange shako and a blue cloak swarthy sunburned 
and with a hooked nose then came two more and many more running
behind one of them said something strange not in russian in among the
hindmost of these men wearing similar shakos was a russian hussar he
was being held by the arms and his horse was being led behind him 

 it must be one of ours a prisoner yes can it be that they will
take me too who are these men thought rost v scarcely believing
his eyes can they be french he looked at the approaching
frenchmen and though but a moment before he had been galloping to get
at them and hack them to pieces their proximity now seemed so awful
that he could not believe his eyes who are they why are they
running can they be coming at me and why to kill me me whom everyone
is so fond of he remembered his mother s love for him and his
family s and his friends and the enemy s intention to kill him
seemed impossible but perhaps they may do it for more than ten
seconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing the situation 
the foremost frenchman the one with the hooked nose was already so
close that the expression of his face could be seen and the excited 
alien face of that man his bayonet hanging down holding his breath 
and running so lightly frightened rost v he seized his pistol and 
instead of firing it flung it at the frenchman and ran with all his
might toward the bushes he did not now run with the feeling of doubt
and conflict with which he had trodden the enns bridge but with the
feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds one single sentiment that
of fear for his young and happy life possessed his whole being rapidly
leaping the furrows he fled across the field with the impetuosity he
used to show at catchplay now and then turning his good natured pale 
young face to look back a shudder of terror went through him no 
better not look he thought but having reached the bushes he glanced
round once more the french had fallen behind and just as he looked
round the first man changed his run to a walk and turning shouted
something loudly to a comrade farther back rost v paused no 
there s some mistake thought he they can t have wanted to
kill me but at the same time his left arm felt as heavy as if
a seventy pound weight were tied to it he could run no more the
frenchman also stopped and took aim rost v closed his eyes and stooped
down one bullet and then another whistled past him he mustered his
last remaining strength took hold of his left hand with his right and
reached the bushes behind these were some russian sharpshooters 





chapter xx

the infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts
of the wood ran out of it the different companies getting mixed and
retreated as a disorderly crowd one soldier in his fear uttered the
senseless cry cut off that is so terrible in battle and that
word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic 

 surrounded cut off we re lost shouted the fugitives 

the moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind the general
realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment and the
thought that he an exemplary officer of many years service who
had never been to blame might be held responsible at headquarters
for negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that forgetting the
recalcitrant cavalry colonel his own dignity as a general and above
all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for self preservation he
clutched the crupper of his saddle and spurring his horse galloped to
the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around but fortunately
missed him his one desire was to know what was happening and at any
cost correct or remedy the mistake if he had made one so that he 
an exemplary officer of twenty two years service who had never been
censured should not be held to blame 

having galloped safely through the french he reached a field behind
the copse across which our men regardless of orders were running and
descending the valley that moment of moral hesitation which decides
the fate of battles had arrived would this disorderly crowd of soldiers
attend to the voice of their commander or would they disregarding him 
continue their flight despite his desperate shouts that used to seem
so terrible to the soldiers despite his furious purple countenance
distorted out of all likeness to his former self and the flourishing of
his saber the soldiers all continued to run talking firing into the
air and disobeying orders the moral hesitation which decided the fate
of battles was evidently culminating in a panic 

the general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the
powder smoke and stopped in despair everything seemed lost but at that
moment the french who were attacking suddenly and without any apparent
reason ran back and disappeared from the outskirts and russian
sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse it was tim khin s
company which alone had maintained its order in the wood and having
lain in ambush in a ditch now attacked the french unexpectedly 
tim khin armed only with a sword had rushed at the enemy with such
a desperate cry and such mad drunken determination that taken by
surprise the french had thrown down their muskets and run d lokhov 
running beside tim khin killed a frenchman at close quarters and was
the first to seize the surrendering french officer by his collar our
fugitives returned the battalions re formed and the french who had
nearly cut our left flank in half were for the moment repulsed our
reserve units were able to join up and the fight was at an end the
regimental commander and major ekon mov had stopped beside a bridge 
letting the retreating companies pass by them when a soldier came up
and took hold of the commander s stirrup almost leaning against him 
the man was wearing a bluish coat of broadcloth he had no knapsack
or cap his head was bandaged and over his shoulder a french munition
pouch was slung he had an officer s sword in his hand the soldier
was pale his blue eyes looked impudently into the commander s face 
and his lips were smiling though the commander was occupied in giving
instructions to major ekon mov he could not help taking notice of the
soldier 

 your excellency here are two trophies said d lokhov pointing
to the french sword and pouch i have taken an officer prisoner i
stopped the company d lokhov breathed heavily from weariness and
spoke in abrupt sentences the whole company can bear witness i beg
you will remember this your excellency 

 all right all right replied the commander and turned to major
ekon mov 

but d lokhov did not go away he untied the handkerchief around his
head pulled it off and showed the blood congealed on his hair 

 a bayonet wound i remained at the front remember your
excellency 


t shin s battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the
action did prince bagrati n still hearing the cannonade in the center 
send his orderly staff officer and later prince andrew also to order
the battery to retire as quickly as possible when the supports attached
to t shin s battery had been moved away in the middle of the action
by someone s order the battery had continued firing and was only not
captured by the french because the enemy could not surmise that anyone
could have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended
guns on the contrary the energetic action of that battery led the
french to suppose that here in the center the main russian forces
were concentrated twice they had attempted to attack this point but on
each occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated
guns on the hillock 

soon after prince bagrati n had left him t shin had succeeded in
setting fire to sch n grabern 

 look at them scurrying it s burning just see the smoke fine 
grand look at the smoke the smoke exclaimed the artillerymen 
brightening up 

all the guns without waiting for orders were being fired in the
direction of the conflagration as if urging each other on the soldiers
cried at each shot fine that s good look at it grand the
fire fanned by the breeze was rapidly spreading the french columns
that had advanced beyond the village went back but as though in revenge
for this failure the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village
and began firing them at t shin s battery 

in their childlike glee aroused by the fire and their luck in
successfully cannonading the french our artillerymen only noticed this
battery when two balls and then four more fell among our guns one
knocking over two horses and another tearing off a munition wagon
driver s leg their spirits once roused were however not diminished 
but only changed character the horses were replaced by others from a
reserve gun carriage the wounded were carried away and the four guns
were turned against the ten gun battery t shin s companion officer
had been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour
seventeen of the forty men of the guns crews had been disabled but
the artillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever twice they
noticed the french appearing below them and then they fired grapeshot
at them 

little t shin moving feebly and awkwardly kept telling his orderly to
 refill my pipe for that one and then scattering sparks from it 
ran forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the french 

 smack at em lads he kept saying seizing the guns by the
wheels and working the screws himself 

amid the smoke deafened by the incessant reports which always made him
jump t shin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun 
now aiming now counting the charges now giving orders about replacing
dead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones and shouting in his
feeble voice so high pitched and irresolute his face grew more and
more animated only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and
turn away from the sight shouting angrily at the men who as is always
the case hesitated about lifting the injured or dead the soldiers 
for the most part handsome fellows and as is always the case in an
artillery company a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad
as their officer all looked at their commander like children in an
embarrassing situation and the expression on his face was invariably
reflected on theirs 

owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and
activity t shin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of
fear and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never
occurred to him on the contrary he became more and more elated it
seemed to him that it was a very long time ago almost a day since he
had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot and that the corner
of the field he stood on was well known and familiar ground though he
thought of everything considered everything and did everything the
best of officers could do in his position he was in a state akin to
feverish delirium or drunkenness 

from the deafening sounds of his own guns around him the whistle and
thud of the enemy s cannon balls from the flushed and perspiring
faces of the crew bustling round the guns from the sight of the blood
of men and horses from the little puffs of smoke on the enemy s side
 always followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth a man a
gun a horse from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of
his own had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded
him pleasure the enemy s guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes
from which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker 

 there he s puffing again muttered t shin to himself as a
small cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by
the wind 

 now look out for the ball we ll throw it back 

 what do you want your honor asked an artilleryman standing
close by who heard him muttering 

 nothing only a shell he answered 

 come along our matv vna he said to himself matv vna 
was the name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery which
was large and of an old pattern the french swarming round their guns
seemed to him like ants in that world the handsome drunkard number one
of the second gun s crew was uncle t shin looked at him more
often than at anyone else and took delight in his every movement 
the sound of musketry at the foot of the hill now diminishing now
increasing seemed like someone s breathing he listened intently to
the ebb and flow of these sounds 

 daughter of matthew 

 ah breathing again breathing he muttered to himself 

he imagined himself as an enormously tall powerful man who was throwing
cannon balls at the french with both hands 

 now then matv vna dear old lady don t let me down he was
saying as he moved from the gun when a strange unfamiliar voice called
above his head captain t shin captain 

t shin turned round in dismay it was the staff officer who had turned
him out of the booth at grunth he was shouting in a gasping voice 

 are you mad you have twice been ordered to retreat and you 

 why are they down on me thought t shin looking in alarm at his
superior 

 i don t he muttered holding up two fingers to his cap 
 i 

but the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say a cannon
ball flying close to him caused him to duck and bend over his horse 
he paused and just as he was about to say something more another ball
stopped him he turned his horse and galloped off 

 retire all to retire he shouted from a distance 

the soldiers laughed a moment later an adjutant arrived with the same
order 

it was prince andrew the first thing he saw on riding up to the space
where t shin s guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a
broken leg that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses 
blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring among the limbers lay
several dead men one ball after another passed over as he approached
and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine but the mere thought
of being afraid roused him again i cannot be afraid thought he 
and dismounted slowly among the guns he delivered the order and did
not leave the battery he decided to have the guns removed from their
positions and withdrawn in his presence together with t shin stepping
across the bodies and under a terrible fire from the french he attended
to the removal of the guns 

 a staff officer was here a minute ago but skipped off said an
artilleryman to prince andrew not like your honor 

prince andrew said nothing to t shin they were both so busy as to seem
not to notice one another when having limbered up the only two cannon
that remained uninjured out of the four they began moving down the hill
 one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind prince andrew rode
up to t shin 

 well till we meet again he said holding out his hand to
t shin 

 good by my dear fellow said t shin dear soul good by my
dear fellow and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his
eyes 





chapter xxi

the wind had fallen and black clouds merging with the powder smoke 
hung low over the field of battle on the horizon it was growing
dark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous the
cannonade was dying down but the rattle of musketry behind and on the
right sounded oftener and nearer as soon as t shin with his guns 
continually driving round or coming upon wounded men was out of range
of fire and had descended into the dip he was met by some of the staff 
among them the staff officer and zherk v who had been twice sent to
t shin s battery but had never reached it interrupting one
another they all gave and transmitted orders as to how to proceed 
reprimanding and reproaching him t shin gave no orders and 
silently fearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to
weep without knowing why rode behind on his artillery nag though
the orders were to abandon the wounded many of them dragged themselves
after troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages the jaunty
infantry officer who just before the battle had rushed out of
t shin s wattle shed was laid with a bullet in his stomach on
 matv vna s carriage at the foot of the hill a pale hussar
cadet supporting one hand with the other came up to t shin and asked
for a seat 

 captain for god s sake i ve hurt my arm he said timidly 
 for god s sake i can t walk for god s sake 

it was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and
been refused he asked in a hesitating piteous voice 

 tell them to give me a seat for god s sake 

 give him a seat said t shin lay a cloak for him to sit on 
lad he said addressing his favorite soldier and where is the
wounded officer 

 he has been set down he died replied someone 

 help him up sit down dear fellow sit down spread out the cloak 
ant nov 

the cadet was rost v with one hand he supported the other he was
pale and his jaw trembled shivering feverishly he was placed on
 matv vna the gun from which they had removed the dead officer 
the cloak they spread under him was wet with blood which stained his
breeches and arm 

 what are you wounded my lad said t shin approaching the gun
on which rost v sat 

 no it s a sprain 

 then what is this blood on the gun carriage inquired t shin 

 it was the officer your honor stained it answered the
artilleryman wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve as if
apologizing for the state of his gun 

it was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the
infantry and having reached the village of gruntersdorf they halted it
had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces
off and the firing had begun to subside suddenly near by on the
right shouting and firing were again heard flashes of shot gleamed in
the darkness this was the last french attack and was met by soldiers
who had sheltered in the village houses they all rushed out of
the village again but t shin s guns could not move and the
artillerymen t shin and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they
awaited their fate the firing died down and soldiers talking eagerly 
streamed out of a side street 

 not hurt petr v asked one 

 we ve given it em hot mate they won t make another push
now said another 

 you couldn t see a thing how they shot at their own fellows 
nothing could be seen pitch dark brother isn t there something to
drink 

the french had been repulsed for the last time and again and again in
the complete darkness t shin s guns moved forward surrounded by the
humming infantry as by a frame 

in the darkness it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing
always in one direction humming with whispers and talk and the sound of
hoofs and wheels amid the general rumble the groans and voices of the
wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness
of the night the gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their
groans which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night 
after a while the moving mass became agitated someone rode past on
a white horse followed by his suite and said something in passing 
 what did he say where to now halt is it did he thank us came
eager questions from all sides the whole moving mass began pressing
closer together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt 
evidently those in front had halted all remained where they were in the
middle of the muddy road 

fires were lighted and the talk became more audible captain t shin 
having given orders to his company sent a soldier to find a dressing
station or a doctor for the cadet and sat down by a bonfire the
soldiers had kindled on the road rost v too dragged himself to the
fire from pain cold and damp a feverish shivering shook his whole
body drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him but he kept awake by
an excruciating pain in his arm for which he could find no satisfactory
position he kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire 
which seemed to him dazzlingly red and at the feeble round shouldered
figure of t shin who was sitting cross legged like a turk beside him 
t shin s large kind intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and
commiseration on rost v who saw that t shin with his whole heart
wished to help him but could not 

from all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry who
were walking driving past and settling down all around the sound
of voices the tramping feet the horses hoofs moving in mud the
crackling of wood fires near and afar merged into one tremulous rumble 

it was no longer as before a dark unseen river flowing through the
gloom but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm 
rost v looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and
around him an infantryman came to the fire squatted on his heels held
his hands to the blaze and turned away his face 

 you don t mind your honor he asked t shin i ve lost my
company your honor i don t know where such bad luck 

with the soldier an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to
the bonfire and addressing t shin asked him to have the guns moved a
trifle to let a wagon go past after he had gone two soldiers rushed to
the campfire they were quarreling and fighting desperately each trying
to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to 

 you picked it up i dare say you re very smart one of them
shouted hoarsely 

then a thin pale soldier his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg
band came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water 

 must one die like a dog said he 

t shin told them to give the man some water then a cheerful soldier
ran up begging a little fire for the infantry 

 a nice little hot torch for the infantry good luck to you fellow
countrymen thanks for the fire we ll return it with interest 
said he carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick 

next came four soldiers carrying something heavy on a cloak and passed
by the fire one of them stumbled 

 who the devil has put the logs on the road snarled he 

 he s dead why carry him said another 

 shut up 

and they disappeared into the darkness with their load 

 still aching t shin asked rost v in a whisper 

 yes 

 your honor you re wanted by the general he is in the hut here 
said a gunner coming up to t shin 

 coming friend 

t shin rose and buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight 
walked away from the fire 

not far from the artillery campfire in a hut that had been prepared
for him prince bagrati n sat at dinner talking with some commanding
officers who had gathered at his quarters the little old man with
the half closed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone and the
general who had served blamelessly for twenty two years flushed by a
glass of vodka and the dinner and the staff officer with the signet
ring and zherk v uneasily glancing at them all and prince andrew 
pale with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes 

in a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the french and
the accountant with the na ve face was feeling its texture shaking his
head in perplexity perhaps because the banner really interested him 
perhaps because it was hard for him hungry as he was to look on at
a dinner where there was no place for him in the next hut there was a
french colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons our officers
were flocking in to look at him prince bagrati n was thanking the
individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our
losses the general whose regiment had been inspected at braunau was
informing the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn
from the wood mustered the men who were woodcutting and allowing the
french to pass him had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and
had broken up the french troops 

 when i saw your excellency that their first battalion was
disorganized i stopped in the road and thought i ll let them
come on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalion and
that s what i did 

the general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed
to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened perhaps
it might really have been so could one possibly make out amid all that
confusion what did or did not happen 

 by the way your excellency i should inform you he
continued remembering d lokhov s conversation with kut zov and his
last interview with the gentleman ranker that private d lokhov 
who was reduced to the ranks took a french officer prisoner in my
presence and particularly distinguished himself 

 i saw the p vlograd hussars attack there your excellency chimed
in zherk v looking uneasily around he had not seen the hussars all
that day but had heard about them from an infantry officer they
broke up two squares your excellency 

several of those present smiled at zherk v s words expecting one of
his usual jokes but noticing that what he was saying redounded to
the glory of our arms and of the day s work they assumed a serious
expression though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie
devoid of any foundation prince bagrati n turned to the old colonel 

 gentlemen i thank you all all arms have behaved heroically 
infantry cavalry and artillery how was it that two guns were
abandoned in the center he inquired searching with his eyes for
someone prince bagrati n did not ask about the guns on the left
flank he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned at the very
beginning of the action i think i sent you he added turning to
the staff officer on duty 

 one was damaged answered the staff officer and the other i
can t understand i was there all the time giving orders and had only
just left it is true that it was hot there he added modestly 

someone mentioned that captain t shin was bivouacking close to the
village and had already been sent for 

 oh but you were there said prince bagrati n addressing prince
andrew 

 of course we only just missed one another said the staff
officer with a smile to bolk nski 

 i had not the pleasure of seeing you said prince andrew coldly
and abruptly 

all were silent t shin appeared at the threshold and made his way
timidly from behind the backs of the generals as he stepped past the
generals in the crowded hut feeling embarrassed as he always was by the
sight of his superiors he did not notice the staff of the banner and
stumbled over it several of those present laughed 

 how was it a gun was abandoned asked bagrati n frowning not so
much at the captain as at those who were laughing among whom zherk v
laughed loudest 

only now when he was confronted by the stern authorities did his guilt
and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present
themselves to t shin in all their horror he had been so excited that
he had not thought about it until that moment the officers laughter
confused him still more he stood before bagrati n with his lower
jaw trembling and was hardly able to mutter i don t know your
excellency i had no men your excellency 

 you might have taken some from the covering troops 

t shin did not say that there were no covering troops though that
was perfectly true he was afraid of getting some other officer into
trouble and silently fixed his eyes on bagrati n as a schoolboy who
has blundered looks at an examiner 

the silence lasted some time prince bagrati n apparently not wishing
to be severe found nothing to say the others did not venture to
intervene prince andrew looked at t shin from under his brows and his
fingers twitched nervously 

 your excellency prince andrew broke the silence with his abrupt
voice you were pleased to send me to captain t shin s battery i
went there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out two
guns smashed and no supports at all 

prince bagrati n and t shin looked with equal intentness at
bolk nski who spoke with suppressed agitation 

 and if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion he
continued we owe today s success chiefly to the action of that
battery and the heroic endurance of captain t shin and his company 
and without awaiting a reply prince andrew rose and left the table 

prince bagrati n looked at t shin evidently reluctant to show
distrust in bolk nski s emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully
to credit it bent his head and told t shin that he could go prince
andrew went out with him 

 thank you you saved me my dear fellow said t shin 

prince andrew gave him a look but said nothing and went away he felt
sad and depressed it was all so strange so unlike what he had hoped 


 who are they why are they here what do they want and when will
all this end thought rost v looking at the changing shadows before
him the pain in his arm became more and more intense irresistible
drowsiness overpowered him red rings danced before his eyes and the
impression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged
with the physical pain it was they these soldiers wounded and
unwounded it was they who were crushing weighing down and twisting
the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder to
rid himself of them he closed his eyes 

for a moment he dozed but in that short interval innumerable things
appeared to him in a dream his mother and her large white hand 
s nya s thin little shoulders nat sha s eyes and laughter 
den sov with his voice and mustache and tely nin and all that affair
with tely nin and bogd nich that affair was the same thing as this
soldier with the harsh voice and it was that affair and this soldier
that were so agonizingly incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and
always dragging it in one direction he tried to get away from them but
they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hair s breadth 
it would not ache it would be well if only they did not pull it but
it was impossible to get rid of them 

he opened his eyes and looked up the black canopy of night hung less
than a yard above the glow of the charcoal flakes of falling snow were
fluttering in that light t shin had not returned the doctor had not
come he was alone now except for a soldier who was sitting naked at
the other side of the fire warming his thin yellow body 

 nobody wants me thought rost v there is no one to help me or
pity me yet i was once at home strong happy and loved he sighed
and doing so groaned involuntarily 

 eh is anything hurting you asked the soldier shaking his shirt
out over the fire and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and
added what a lot of men have been crippled today frightful 

rost v did not listen to the soldier he looked at the snowflakes
fluttering above the fire and remembered a russian winter at his warm 
bright home his fluffy fur coat his quickly gliding sleigh his
healthy body and all the affection and care of his family and why
did i come here he wondered 

next day the french army did not renew their attack and the remnant of
bagrati n s detachment was reunited to kut zov s army 





book three 1805





chapter i

prince vas li was not a man who deliberately thought out his plans 
still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage he
was merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had
become a habit schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted
to himself but which formed the whole interest of his life 
were constantly shaping themselves in his mind arising from the
circumstances and persons he met of these plans he had not merely one
or two in his head but dozens some only beginning to form themselves 
some approaching achievement and some in course of disintegration he
did not for instance say to himself this man now has influence i
must gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special
grant nor did he say to himself pierre is a rich man i must
entice him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles
i need but when he came across a man of position his instinct
immediately told him that this man could be useful and without any
premeditation prince vas li took the first opportunity to gain his
confidence flatter him become intimate with him and finally make his
request 

he had pierre at hand in moscow and procured for him an appointment as
gentleman of the bedchamber which at that time conferred the status of
councilor of state and insisted on the young man accompanying him to
petersburg and staying at his house with apparent absent mindedness 
yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing 
prince vas li did everything to get pierre to marry his daughter had
he thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural
and shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both
above and below him in social standing something always drew him toward
those richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in
seizing the most opportune moment for making use of people 

pierre on unexpectedly becoming count bez khov and a rich man felt
himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and
preoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself he had to
sign papers to present himself at government offices the purpose of
which was not clear to him to question his chief steward to visit his
estate near moscow and to receive many people who formerly did not
even wish to know of his existence but would now have been offended
and grieved had he chosen not to see them these different
people businessmen relations and acquaintances alike were all
disposed to treat the young heir in the most friendly and flattering
manner they were all evidently firmly convinced of pierre s noble
qualities he was always hearing such words as with your remarkable
kindness or with your excellent heart you are yourself so
honorable count or were he as clever as you and so on 
till he began sincerely to believe in his own exceptional kindness and
extraordinary intelligence the more so as in the depth of his heart it
had always seemed to him that he really was very kind and intelligent 
even people who had formerly been spiteful toward him and evidently
unfriendly now became gentle and affectionate the angry eldest
princess with the long waist and hair plastered down like a doll s 
had come into pierre s room after the funeral with drooping eyes
and frequent blushes she told him she was very sorry about their past
misunderstandings and did not now feel she had a right to ask him for
anything except only for permission after the blow she had received 
to remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so loved and where
she had sacrificed so much she could not refrain from weeping at these
words touched that this statuesque princess could so change pierre
took her hand and begged her forgiveness without knowing what for 
from that day the eldest princess quite changed toward pierre and began
knitting a striped scarf for him 

 do this for my sake mon cher after all she had to put up with a
great deal from the deceased said prince vas li to him handing him
a deed to sign for the princess benefit 

prince vas li had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw
this bone a bill for thirty thousand rubles to the poor princess
that it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of
the inlaid portfolio pierre signed the deed and after that the princess
grew still kinder the younger sisters also became affectionate to him 
especially the youngest the pretty one with the mole who often made
him feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him 

it seemed so natural to pierre that everyone should like him and it
would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him that he could
not but believe in the sincerity of those around him besides he had
no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not he
was always busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful
intoxication he felt as though he were the center of some important and
general movement that something was constantly expected of him that if
he did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many people but if he
did this and that all would be well and he did what was demanded of
him but still that happy result always remained in the future 

more than anyone else prince vas li took possession of pierre s
affairs and of pierre himself in those early days from the death of
count bez khov he did not let go his hold of the lad he had the air of
a man oppressed by business weary and suffering who yet would not for
pity s sake leave this helpless youth who after all was the son of
his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth to the caprice
of fate and the designs of rogues during the few days he spent in
moscow after the death of count bez khov he would call pierre or
go to him himself and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of
weariness and assurance as if he were adding every time you know
i am overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that
i trouble myself about you and you also know quite well that what i
propose is the only thing possible 

 well my dear fellow tomorrow we are off at last said prince
vas li one day closing his eyes and fingering pierre s elbow 
speaking as if he were saying something which had long since been agreed
upon and could not now be altered we start tomorrow and i m giving
you a place in my carriage i am very glad all our important business
here is now settled and i ought to have been off long ago here is
something i have received from the chancellor i asked him for you and
you have been entered in the diplomatic corps and made a gentleman of
the bedchamber the diplomatic career now lies open before you 

notwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these words
were pronounced pierre who had so long been considering his career 
wished to make some suggestion but prince vas li interrupted him in
the special deep cooing tone precluding the possibility of interrupting
his speech which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion was
needed 

 mais mon cher i did this for my own sake to satisfy my conscience 
and there is nothing to thank me for no one has ever complained yet of
being too much loved and besides you are free you could throw it
up tomorrow but you will see everything for yourself when you get to
petersburg it is high time for you to get away from these terrible
recollections prince vas li sighed yes yes my boy and my
valet can go in your carriage ah i was nearly forgetting he added 
 you know mon cher your father and i had some accounts to settle so
i have received what was due from the ryaz n estate and will keep it 
you won t require it we ll go into the accounts later 

by what was due from the ryaz n estate prince vas li meant
several thousand rubles quitrent received from pierre s peasants 
which the prince had retained for himself 

in petersburg as in moscow pierre found the same atmosphere of
gentleness and affection he could not refuse the post or rather the
rank for he did nothing that prince vas li had procured for him 
and acquaintances invitations and social occupations were so numerous
that even more than in moscow he felt a sense of bewilderment bustle 
and continual expectation of some good always in front of him but never
attained 

of his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in petersburg 
the guards had gone to the front d lokhov had been reduced to the
ranks anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces prince andrew
was abroad so pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he
used to like to spend them or to open his mind by intimate talks with
a friend older than himself and whom he respected his whole time
was taken up with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at prince
vas li s house in the company of the stout princess his wife and
his beautiful daughter h l ne 

like the others anna p vlovna sch rer showed pierre the change of
attitude toward him that had taken place in society 

formerly in anna p vlovna s presence pierre had always felt that
what he was saying was out of place tactless and unsuitable that
remarks which seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became
foolish as soon as he uttered them while on the contrary hippolyte s
stupidest remarks came out clever and apt now everything pierre said
was charmant even if anna p vlovna did not say so he could see that
she wished to and only refrained out of regard for his modesty 

in the beginning of the winter of 1805 6 pierre received one of anna
p vlovna s usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added 
 you will find the beautiful h l ne here whom it is always
delightful to see 

when he read that sentence pierre felt for the first time that some
link which other people recognized had grown up between himself and
h l ne and that thought both alarmed him as if some obligation were
being imposed on him which he could not fulfill and pleased him as an
entertaining supposition 

anna p vlovna s at home was like the former one only the
novelty she offered her guests this time was not mortemart but a
diplomatist fresh from berlin with the very latest details of the
emperor alexander s visit to potsdam and of how the two august
friends had pledged themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold
the cause of justice against the enemy of the human race anna p vlovna
received pierre with a shade of melancholy evidently relating to the
young man s recent loss by the death of count bez khov everyone
constantly considered it a duty to assure pierre that he was greatly
afflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known and her
melancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the mention
of her most august majesty the empress m rya f dorovna pierre felt
flattered by this anna p vlovna arranged the different groups in her
drawing room with her habitual skill the large group in which were
prince vas li and the generals had the benefit of the diplomat 
another group was at the tea table pierre wished to join the former 
but anna p vlovna who was in the excited condition of a commander on
a battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which
there is hardly time to put in action seeing pierre touched his
sleeve with her finger saying 

 wait a bit i have something in view for you this evening 
 she glanced at h l ne and smiled at her my dear h l ne be
charitable to my poor aunt who adores you go and keep her company for
ten minutes and that it will not be too dull here is the dear count
who will not refuse to accompany you 

the beauty went to the aunt but anna p vlovna detained pierre looking
as if she had to give some final necessary instructions 

 isn t she exquisite she said to pierre pointing to the stately
beauty as she glided away and how she carries herself for so young
a girl such tact such masterly perfection of manner it comes from
her heart happy the man who wins her with her the least worldly of men
would occupy a most brilliant position in society don t you think so 
i only wanted to know your opinion and anna p vlovna let pierre go 

pierre in reply sincerely agreed with her as to h l ne s
perfection of manner if he ever thought of h l ne it was just of
her beauty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in
society 

the old aunt received the two young people in her corner but seemed
desirous of hiding her adoration for h l ne and inclined rather
to show her fear of anna p vlovna she looked at her niece as if
inquiring what she was to do with these people on leaving them anna
p vlovna again touched pierre s sleeve saying i hope you won t
say that it is dull in my house again and she glanced at h l ne 

h l ne smiled with a look implying that she did not admit the
possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted the aunt
coughed swallowed and said in french that she was very pleased to see
h l ne then she turned to pierre with the same words of welcome
and the same look in the middle of a dull and halting conversation 
h l ne turned to pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave
to everyone pierre was so used to that smile and it had so little
meaning for him that he paid no attention to it the aunt was just
speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to pierre s
father count bez khov and showed them her own box princess h l ne
asked to see the portrait of the aunt s husband on the box lid 

 that is probably the work of vinesse said pierre mentioning
a celebrated miniaturist and he leaned over the table to take the
snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table 

he half rose meaning to go round but the aunt handed him the snuffbox 
passing it across h l ne s back h l ne stooped forward to make
room and looked round with a smile she was as always at evening
parties wearing a dress such as was then fashionable cut very low at
front and back her bust which had always seemed like marble to pierre 
was so close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive
the living charm of her neck and shoulders so near to his lips that
he need only have bent his head a little to have touched them he was
conscious of the warmth of her body the scent of perfume and the
creaking of her corset as she moved he did not see her marble beauty
forming a complete whole with her dress but all the charm of her body
only covered by her garments and having once seen this he could not
help being aware of it just as we cannot renew an illusion we have once
seen through 

 so you have never noticed before how beautiful i am h l ne
seemed to say you had not noticed that i am a woman yes i am a
woman who may belong to anyone to you too said her glance and at
that moment pierre felt that h l ne not only could but must be his
wife and that it could not be otherwise 

he knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the
altar with her how and when this would be he did not know he did not
even know if it would be a good thing he even felt he knew not why 
that it would be a bad thing but he knew it would happen 

pierre dropped his eyes lifted them again and wished once more to see
her as a distant beauty far removed from him as he had seen her every
day until then but he could no longer do it he could not any more
than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the
mist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has
once recognized it to be a tuft of grass she was terribly close to him 
she already had power over him and between them there was no longer any
barrier except the barrier of his own will 

 well i will leave you in your little corner came anna
p vlovna s voice i see you are all right there 

and pierre anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything
reprehensible looked round with a blush it seemed to him that everyone
knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself 

a little later when he went up to the large circle anna p vlovna said
to him i hear you are refitting your petersburg house 

this was true the architect had told him that it was necessary and
pierre without knowing why was having his enormous petersburg house
done up 

 that s a good thing but don t move from prince vas li s it
is good to have a friend like the prince she said smiling at prince
vas li i know something about that don t i and you are still so
young you need advice don t be angry with me for exercising an old
woman s privilege 

she paused as women always do expecting something after they have
mentioned their age if you marry it will be a different thing 
she continued uniting them both in one glance pierre did not look at
h l ne nor she at him but she was just as terribly close to him he
muttered something and colored 

when he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what
had happened what had happened nothing he had merely understood that
the woman he had known as a child of whom when her beauty was mentioned
he had said absent mindedly yes she s good looking he had
understood that this woman might belong to him 

 but she s stupid i have myself said she is stupid he thought 
 there is something nasty something wrong in the feeling she excites
in me i have been told that her brother anatole was in love with her
and she with him that there was quite a scandal and that that s why
he was sent away hippolyte is her brother prince vas li is her
father it s bad he reflected but while he was thinking this
 the reflection was still incomplete he caught himself smiling and was
conscious that another line of thought had sprung up and while thinking
of her worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be his
wife how she would love him become quite different and how all he had
thought and heard of her might be false and he again saw her not as the
daughter of prince vas li but visualized her whole body only veiled
by its gray dress but no why did this thought never occur to me
before and again he told himself that it was impossible that there
would be something unnatural and as it seemed to him dishonorable in
this marriage he recalled her former words and looks and the words
and looks of those who had seen them together he recalled anna
p vlovna s words and looks when she spoke to him about his house 
recalled thousands of such hints from prince vas li and others and was
seized by terror lest he had already in some way bound himself to do
something that was evidently wrong and that he ought not to do but at
the very time he was expressing this conviction to himself in another
part of his mind her image rose in all its womanly beauty 





chapter ii

in november 1805 prince vas li had to go on a tour of inspection
in four different provinces he had arranged this for himself so as to
visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son anatole
where his regiment was stationed and take him to visit prince nicholas
bolk nski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that
rich old man but before leaving home and undertaking these new affairs 
prince vas li had to settle matters with pierre who it is true had
latterly spent whole days at home that is in prince vas li s house
where he was staying and had been absurd excited and foolish in
h l ne s presence as a lover should be but had not yet proposed
to her 

 this is all very fine but things must be settled said prince
vas li to himself with a sorrowful sigh one morning feeling that
pierre who was under such obligations to him but never mind that 
was not behaving very well in this matter youth frivolity well 
god be with him thought he relishing his own goodness of heart 
 but it must be brought to a head the day after tomorrow will be
l lya s name day i will invite two or three people and if he does
not understand what he ought to do then it will be my affair yes my
affair i am her father 

six weeks after anna p vlovna s at home and after the sleepless
night when he had decided that to marry h l ne would be a calamity and
that he ought to avoid her and go away pierre despite that decision 
had not left prince vas li s and felt with terror that in people s
eyes he was every day more and more connected with her that it was
impossible for him to return to his former conception of her that he
could not break away from her and that though it would be a terrible
thing he would have to unite his fate with hers he might perhaps have
been able to free himself but that prince vas li who had rarely before
given receptions now hardly let a day go by without having an evening
party at which pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil
the general pleasure and disappoint everyone s expectation prince
vas li in the rare moments when he was at home would take pierre s
hand in passing and draw it downwards or absent mindedly hold out his
wrinkled clean shaven cheek for pierre to kiss and would say till
tomorrow or be in to dinner or i shall not see you or i
am staying in for your sake and so on and though prince vas li 
when he stayed in as he said for pierre s sake hardly exchanged a
couple of words with him pierre felt unable to disappoint him 
every day he said to himself one and the same thing it is time i
understood her and made up my mind what she really is was i mistaken
before or am i mistaken now no she is not stupid she is an excellent
girl he sometimes said to himself she never makes a mistake 
never says anything stupid she says little but what she does say is
always clear and simple so she is not stupid she never was abashed and
is not abashed now so she cannot be a bad woman he had often begun
to make reflections or think aloud in her company and she had always
answered him either by a brief but appropriate remark showing that it
did not interest her or by a silent look and smile which more palpably
than anything else showed pierre her superiority she was right in
regarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile 

she always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him
alone in which there was something more significant than in the general
smile that usually brightened her face pierre knew that everyone was
waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line and he knew that
sooner or later he would step across it but an incomprehensible terror
seized him at the thought of that dreadful step a thousand times during
that month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to
that dreadful abyss pierre said to himself what am i doing i need
resolution can it be that i have none 

he wished to take a decision but felt with dismay that in this matter
he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really
possessed pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel
themselves quite innocent and since that day when he was overpowered
by a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at anna
p vlovna s an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire
paralyzed his will 

on h l ne s name day a small party of just their own people as
his wife said met for supper at prince vas li s all these friends
and relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young
girl would be decided that evening the visitors were seated at supper 
princess kur gina a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome 
was sitting at the head of the table on either side of her sat the
more important guests an old general and his wife and anna p vlovna
sch rer at the other end sat the younger and less important guests 
and there too sat the members of the family and pierre and h l ne 
side by side prince vas li was not having any supper he went round
the table in a merry mood sitting down now by one now by another of
the guests to each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark
except to pierre and h l ne whose presence he seemed not to notice 
he enlivened the whole party the wax candles burned brightly the
silver and crystal gleamed so did the ladies toilets and the gold
and silver of the men s epaulets servants in scarlet liveries moved
round the table the clatter of plates knives and glasses mingled with
the animated hum of several conversations at one end of the table the
old chamberlain was heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her
passionately at which she laughed at the other could be heard the
story of the misfortunes of some mary v ktorovna or other at the
center of the table prince vas li attracted everybody s attention 
with a facetious smile on his face he was telling the ladies about last
wednesday s meeting of the imperial council at which serg y kuzm ch
vyazm tinov the new military governor general of petersburg had
received and read the then famous rescript of the emperor alexander
from the army to serg y kuzm ch in which the emperor said that he was
receiving from all sides declarations of the people s loyalty that
the declaration from petersburg gave him particular pleasure and that
he was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would endeavor to be
worthy of it this rescript began with the words serg y kuzm ch 
from all sides reports reach me etc 

 well and so he never got farther than serg y kuzm ch 
asked one of the ladies 

 exactly not a hair s breadth farther answered prince vas li 
laughing serg y kuzm ch from all sides from all sides 
serg y kuzm ch poor vyazm tinov could not get any farther 
he began the rescript again and again but as soon as he uttered
 serg y he sobbed kuz m ch tears and from all
sides was smothered in sobs and he could get no farther and again
his handkerchief and again serg y kuzm ch from all sides 
and tears till at last somebody else was asked to read it 

 kuzm ch from all sides and then tears someone repeated
laughing 

 don t be unkind cried anna p vlovna from her end of the table
holding up a threatening finger he is such a worthy and excellent
man our dear vyazm tinov 

everybody laughed a great deal at the head of the table where the
honored guests sat everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the
influence of a variety of exciting sensations only pierre and
h l ne sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table a
suppressed smile brightening both their faces a smile that had nothing
to do with serg y kuzm ch a smile of bashfulness at their own
feelings but much as all the rest laughed talked and joked much
as they enjoyed their rhine wine saut and ices and however they
avoided looking at the young couple and heedless and unobservant as
they seemed of them one could feel by the occasional glances they gave
that the story about serg y kuzm ch the laughter and the food
were all a pretense and that the whole attention of that company was
directed to pierre and h l ne prince vas li mimicked the sobbing
of serg y kuzm ch and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his
daughter and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said 
 yes it s getting on it will all be settled today anna
p vlovna threatened him on behalf of our dear vyazm tinov and
in her eyes which for an instant glanced at pierre prince vas li
read a congratulation on his future son in law and on his daughter s
happiness the old princess sighed sadly as she offered some wine to the
old lady next to her and glanced angrily at her daughter and her sigh
seemed to say yes there s nothing left for you and me but to sip
sweet wine my dear now that the time has come for these young ones to
be thus boldly provocatively happy and what nonsense all this is
that i am saying thought a diplomatist glancing at the happy faces
of the lovers that s happiness 

into the insignificant trifling and artificial interests uniting that
society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy
and handsome young man and woman for one another and this human feeling
dominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatter 
jests fell flat news was not interesting and the animation was
evidently forced not only the guests but even the footmen waiting at
table seemed to feel this and they forgot their duties as they looked
at the beautiful h l ne with her radiant face and at the red broad 
and happy though uneasy face of pierre it seemed as if the very light
of the candles was focused on those two happy faces alone 

pierre felt that he was the center of it all and this both pleased and
embarrassed him he was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation 
he did not see hear or understand anything clearly only now and
then detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot
unexpectedly through his mind 

 so it is all finished he thought and how has it all happened 
how quickly now i know that not because of her alone nor of myself
alone but because of everyone it must inevitably come about they are
all expecting it they are so sure that it will happen that i cannot i
cannot disappoint them but how will it be i do not know but it
will certainly happen thought pierre glancing at those dazzling
shoulders close to his eyes 

or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what he felt it
awkward to attract everyone s attention and to be considered a
lucky man and with his plain face to be looked on as a sort of paris
possessed of a helen but no doubt it always is and must be so 
he consoled himself and besides what have i done to bring it about 
how did it begin i traveled from moscow with prince vas li then there
was nothing so why should i not stay at his house then i played cards
with her and picked up her reticule and drove out with her how did it
begin when did it all come about and here he was sitting by her
side as her betrothed seeing hearing feeling her nearness her
breathing her movements her beauty then it would suddenly seem to him
that it was not she but he was so unusually beautiful and that that was
why they all looked so at him and flattered by this general admiration
he would expand his chest raise his head and rejoice at his good
fortune suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a
second time but pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what
was said 

 i am asking you when you last heard from bolk nski repeated
prince vas li a third time how absent minded you are my dear
fellow 

prince vas li smiled and pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at
him and h l ne well what of it if you all know it thought
pierre what of it it s the truth and he himself smiled his
gentle childlike smile and h l ne smiled too 

 when did you get the letter was it from olm tz repeated
prince vas li who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a
dispute 

 how can one talk or think of such trifles thought pierre 

 yes from olm tz he answered with a sigh 

after supper pierre with his partner followed the others into the
drawing room the guests began to disperse some without taking leave
of h l ne some as if unwilling to distract her from an important
occupation came up to her for a moment and made haste to go away 
refusing to let her see them off the diplomatist preserved a mournful
silence as he left the drawing room he pictured the vanity of his
diplomatic career in comparison with pierre s happiness the old
general grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was oh the
old fool he thought that princess h l ne will be beautiful
still when she s fifty 

 i think i may congratulate you whispered anna p vlovna to the
old princess kissing her soundly if i hadn t this headache i d
have stayed longer 

the old princess did not reply she was tormented by jealousy of her
daughter s happiness 

while the guests were taking their leave pierre remained for a long time
alone with h l ne in the little drawing room where they were sitting 
he had often before during the last six weeks remained alone with her 
but had never spoken to her of love now he felt that it was inevitable 
but he could not make up his mind to take the final step he felt
ashamed he felt that he was occupying someone else s place here
beside h l ne this happiness is not for you some inner voice
whispered to him this happiness is for those who have not in them
what there is in you 

but as he had to say something he began by asking her whether she was
satisfied with the party she replied in her usual simple manner that
this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had 

some of the nearest relatives had not yet left they were sitting in
the large drawing room prince vas li came up to pierre with languid
footsteps pierre rose and said it was getting late prince vas li gave
him a look of stern inquiry as though what pierre had just said was
so strange that one could not take it in but then the expression of
severity changed and he drew pierre s hand downwards made him sit
down and smiled affectionately 

 well l lya he asked turning instantly to his daughter and
addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to
parents who have petted their children from babyhood but which prince
vas li had only acquired by imitating other parents 

and he again turned to pierre 

 serg y kuzm ch from all sides he said unbuttoning the top
button of his waistcoat 

pierre smiled but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story
about serg y kuzm ch that interested prince vas li just then and
prince vas li saw that pierre knew this he suddenly muttered
something and went away it seemed to pierre that even the prince was
disconcerted the sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world
touched pierre he looked at h l ne and she too seemed disconcerted 
and her look seemed to say well it is your own fault 

 the step must be taken but i cannot i cannot thought pierre 
and he again began speaking about indifferent matters about serg y
kuzm ch asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it
properly h l ne answered with a smile that she too had missed it 

when prince vas li returned to the drawing room the princess his
wife was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about pierre 

 of course it is a very brilliant match but happiness my dear 

 marriages are made in heaven replied the elderly lady 

prince vas li passed by seeming not to hear the ladies and sat down
on a sofa in a far corner of the room he closed his eyes and seemed to
be dozing his head sank forward and then he roused himself 

 aline he said to his wife go and see what they are about 

the princess went up to the door passed by it with a dignified and
indifferent air and glanced into the little drawing room pierre and
h l ne still sat talking just as before 

 still the same she said to her husband 

prince vas li frowned twisting his mouth his cheeks quivered and his
face assumed the coarse unpleasant expression peculiar to him shaking
himself he rose threw back his head and with resolute steps went
past the ladies into the little drawing room with quick steps he went
joyfully up to pierre his face was so unusually triumphant that pierre
rose in alarm on seeing it 

 thank god said prince vas li my wife has told me
everything he put one arm around pierre and the other around his
daughter my dear boy l lya i am very pleased his
voice trembled i loved your father and she will make you a good
wife god bless you 

he embraced his daughter and then again pierre and kissed him with his
malodorous mouth tears actually moistened his cheeks 

 princess come here he shouted 

the old princess came in and also wept the elderly lady was using
her handkerchief too pierre was kissed and he kissed the beautiful
h l ne s hand several times after a while they were left alone
again 

 all this had to be and could not be otherwise thought pierre 
 so it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad it is good because
it s definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt pierre
held the hand of his betrothed in silence looking at her beautiful
bosom as it rose and fell 

 h l ne he said aloud and paused 

 something special is always said in such cases he thought but
could not remember what it was that people say he looked at her face 
she drew nearer to him her face flushed 

 oh take those off those she said pointing to his
spectacles 

pierre took them off and his eyes besides the strange look eyes have
from which spectacles have just been removed had also a frightened and
inquiring look he was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it but
with a rapid almost brutal movement of her head she intercepted his
lips and met them with her own her face struck pierre by its altered 
unpleasantly excited expression 

 it is too late now it s done besides i love her thought
pierre 

 je vous aime he said remembering what has to be said at such
moments but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself 

 i love you 


six weeks later he was married and settled in count bez khov s
large newly furnished petersburg house the happy possessor as people
said of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money 





chapter iii

old prince nicholas bolk nski received a letter from prince vas li
in november 1805 announcing that he and his son would be paying him
a visit i am starting on a journey of inspection and of course i
shall think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at
the same time my honored benefactor wrote prince vas li my son
anatole is accompanying me on his way to the army so i hope you will
allow him personally to express the deep respect that emulating his
father he feels for you 

 it seems that there will be no need to bring mary out suitors are
coming to us of their own accord incautiously remarked the little
princess on hearing the news 

prince nicholas frowned but said nothing 

a fortnight after the letter prince vas li s servants came one
evening in advance of him and he and his son arrived next day 

old bolk nski had always had a poor opinion of prince vas li s
character but more so recently since in the new reigns of paul and
alexander prince vas li had risen to high position and honors and now 
from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess 
he saw which way the wind was blowing and his low opinion changed into
a feeling of contemptuous ill will he snorted whenever he mentioned
him on the day of prince vas li s arrival prince bolk nski was
particularly discontented and out of temper whether he was in a bad
temper because prince vas li was coming or whether his being in a bad
temper made him specially annoyed at prince vas li s visit he was
in a bad temper and in the morning t khon had already advised the
architect not to go to the prince with his report 

 do you hear how he s walking said t khon drawing the
architect s attention to the sound of the prince s footsteps 
 stepping flat on his heels we know what that means 

however at nine o clock the prince in his velvet coat with a sable
collar and cap went out for his usual walk it had snowed the day
before and the path to the hothouse along which the prince was in the
habit of walking had been swept the marks of the broom were still
visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the
soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path the prince went
through the conservatories the serfs quarters and the outbuildings 
frowning and silent 

 can a sleigh pass he asked his overseer a venerable man 
resembling his master in manners and looks who was accompanying him
back to the house 

 the snow is deep i am having the avenue swept your honor 

the prince bowed his head and went up to the porch god be
thanked thought the overseer the storm has blown over 

 it would have been hard to drive up your honor he added i
heard your honor that a minister is coming to visit your honor 

the prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him 
frowning 

 what a minister what minister who gave orders he said in
his shrill harsh voice the road is not swept for the princess my
daughter but for a minister for me there are no ministers 

 your honor i thought 

 you thought shouted the prince his words coming more and more
rapidly and indistinctly you thought rascals blackguards 
i ll teach you to think and lifting his stick he swung it and
would have hit alp tych the overseer had not the latter instinctively
avoided the blow thought blackguards shouted the prince
rapidly 

but although alp tych frightened at his own temerity in avoiding the
stroke came up to the prince bowing his bald head resignedly before
him or perhaps for that very reason the prince though he continued
to shout blackguards throw the snow back on the road did not
lift his stick again but hurried into the house 

before dinner princess mary and mademoiselle bourienne who knew
that the prince was in a bad humor stood awaiting him mademoiselle
bourienne with a radiant face that said i know nothing i am the
same as usual and princess mary pale frightened and with downcast
eyes what she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions
she ought to behave like mademoiselle bourienne but could not 
she thought if i seem not to notice he will think that i do not
sympathize with him if i seem sad and out of spirits myself he will
say as he has done before that i m in the dumps 

the prince looked at his daughter s frightened face and snorted 

 fool or dummy he muttered 

 and the other one is not here they ve been telling tales he
thought referring to the little princess who was not in the dining
room 

 where is the princess he asked hiding 

 she is not very well answered mademoiselle bourienne with
a bright smile so she won t come down it is natural in her
state 

 hm hm muttered the prince sitting down 

his plate seemed to him not quite clean and pointing to a spot he
flung it away t khon caught it and handed it to a footman the little
princess was not unwell but had such an overpowering fear of the prince
that hearing he was in a bad humor she had decided not to appear 

 i am afraid for the baby she said to mademoiselle bourienne 
 heaven knows what a fright might do 

in general at bald hills the little princess lived in constant fear and
with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not
realize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling the prince
reciprocated this antipathy but it was overpowered by his contempt
for her when the little princess had grown accustomed to life at bald
hills she took a special fancy to mademoiselle bourienne spent whole
days with her asked her to sleep in her room and often talked with her
about the old prince and criticized him 

 so we are to have visitors mon prince remarked mademoiselle
bourienne unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers his
excellency prince vas li kur gin and his son i understand she
said inquiringly 

 hm his excellency is a puppy i got him his appointment in the
service said the prince disdainfully why his son is coming i
don t understand perhaps princess elizabeth and princess mary know 
i don t want him he looked at his blushing daughter are you
unwell today eh afraid of the minister as that idiot alp tych
called him this morning 

 no mon p re 

though mademoiselle bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice
of a subject she did not stop talking but chattered about the
conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened and
after the soup the prince became more genial 

after dinner he went to see his daughter in law the little princess
was sitting at a small table chattering with m sha her maid she grew
pale on seeing her father in law 

she was much altered she was now plain rather than pretty her cheeks
had sunk her lip was drawn up and her eyes drawn down 

 yes i feel a kind of oppression she said in reply to the
prince s question as to how she felt 

 do you want anything 

 no merci mon p re 

 well all right all right 

he left the room and went to the waiting room where alp tych stood with
bowed head 

 has the snow been shoveled back 

 yes your excellency forgive me for heaven s sake it was only
my stupidity 

 all right all right interrupted the prince and laughing his
unnatural way he stretched out his hand for alp tych to kiss and then
proceeded to his study 

prince vas li arrived that evening he was met in the avenue by
coachmen and footmen who with loud shouts dragged his sleighs up to
one of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow 

prince vas li and anatole had separate rooms assigned to them 

anatole having taken off his overcoat sat with arms akimbo before a
table on a corner of which he smilingly and absent mindedly fixed his
large and handsome eyes he regarded his whole life as a continual round
of amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him 
and he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly
heiress in the same way all this might he thought turn out very well
and amusingly and why not marry her if she really has so much money 
that never does any harm thought anatole 

he shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had
become habitual to him and his handsome head held high entered his
father s room with the good humored and victorious air natural to
him prince vas li s two valets were busy dressing him and he looked
round with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter
entered as if to say yes that s how i want you to look 

 i say father joking apart is she very hideous anatole asked 
as if continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been
mentioned during the journey 

 enough what nonsense above all try to be respectful and cautious
with the old prince 

 if he starts a row i ll go away said prince anatole i
can t bear those old men eh 

 remember for you everything depends on this 

in the meantime not only was it known in the maidservants rooms that
the minister and his son had arrived but the appearance of both had
been minutely described princess mary was sitting alone in her room 
vainly trying to master her agitation 

 why did they write why did lise tell me about it it can never
happen she said looking at herself in the glass how shall i
enter the drawing room even if i like him i can t now be myself with
him the mere thought of her father s look filled her with terror 
the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne had already received
from m sha the lady s maid the necessary report of how handsome the
minister s son was with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows and with
what difficulty the father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son
had followed him like an eagle three steps at a time having received
this information the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne whose
chattering voices had reached her from the corridor went into princess
mary s room 

 you know they ve come marie said the little princess waddling
in and sinking heavily into an armchair 

she was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning 
but had on one of her best dresses her hair was carefully done and her
face was animated which however did not conceal its sunken and faded
outlines dressed as she used to be in petersburg society it was still
more noticeable how much plainer she had become some unobtrusive touch
had been added to mademoiselle bourienne s toilet which rendered her
fresh and pretty face yet more attractive 

 what are you going to remain as you are dear princess she
began they ll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing
room and we shall have to go down and you have not smartened yourself
up at all 

the little princess got up rang for the maid and hurriedly and merrily
began to devise and carry out a plan of how princess mary should be
dressed princess mary s self esteem was wounded by the fact that
the arrival of a suitor agitated her and still more so by both
her companions not having the least conception that it could be
otherwise to tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them
would be to betray her agitation while to decline their offers to
dress her would prolong their banter and insistence she flushed her
beautiful eyes grew dim red blotches came on her face and it took
on the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore as she
submitted herself to mademoiselle bourienne and lise both these women
quite sincerely tried to make her look pretty she was so plain that
neither of them could think of her as a rival so they began dressing
her with perfect sincerity and with the na ve and firm conviction
women have that dress can make a face pretty 

 no really my dear this dress is not pretty said lise looking
sideways at princess mary from a little distance you have a maroon
dress have it fetched really you know the fate of your whole life may
be at stake but this one is too light it s not becoming 

it was not the dress but the face and whole figure of princess mary
that was not pretty but neither mademoiselle bourienne nor the little
princess felt this they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed
in the hair the hair combed up and the blue scarf arranged lower on
the best maroon dress and so on all would be well they forgot that
the frightened face and the figure could not be altered and that
however they might change the setting and adornment of that face it
would still remain piteous and plain after two or three changes to
which princess mary meekly submitted just as her hair had been arranged
on the top of her head a style that quite altered and spoiled her
looks and she had put on a maroon dress with a pale blue scarf the
little princess walked twice round her now adjusting a fold of the
dress with her little hand now arranging the scarf and looking at her
with her head bent first on one side and then on the other 

 no it will not do she said decidedly clasping her hands no 
mary really this dress does not suit you i prefer you in your little
gray everyday dress now please do it for my sake katie she said
to the maid bring the princess her gray dress and you ll see 
mademoiselle bourienne how i shall arrange it she added smiling
with a foretaste of artistic pleasure 

but when katie brought the required dress princess mary remained
sitting motionless before the glass looking at her face and saw in the
mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering ready to burst
into sobs 

 come dear princess said mademoiselle bourienne just one more
little effort 

the little princess taking the dress from the maid came up to princess
mary 

 well now we ll arrange something quite simple and becoming she
said 

the three voices hers mademoiselle bourienne s and katie s who
was laughing at something mingled in a merry sound like the chirping
of birds 

 no leave me alone said princess mary 

her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds
was silenced at once they looked at the beautiful large thoughtful
eyes full of tears and of thoughts gazing shiningly and imploringly at
them and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist 

 at least change your coiffure said the little princess 
 didn t i tell you she went on turning reproachfully to
mademoiselle bourienne mary s is a face which such a coiffure does
not suit in the least not in the least please change it 

 leave me alone please leave me alone it is all quite the same to
me answered a voice struggling with tears 

mademoiselle bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves
that princess mary in this guise looked very plain worse than usual 
but it was too late she was looking at them with an expression they
both knew an expression thoughtful and sad this expression in princess
mary did not frighten them she never inspired fear in anyone but they
knew that when it appeared on her face she became mute and was not to
be shaken in her determination 

 you will change it won t you said lise and as princess mary
gave no answer she left the room 

princess mary was left alone she did not comply with lise s request 
she not only left her hair as it was but did not even look in her
glass letting her arms fall helplessly she sat with downcast eyes and
pondered a husband a man a strong dominant and strangely attractive
being rose in her imagination and carried her into a totally different
happy world of his own she fancied a child her own such as she had
seen the day before in the arms of her nurse s daughter at her
own breast the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the
child but no it is impossible i am too ugly she thought 

 please come to tea the prince will be out in a moment came the
maid s voice at the door 

she roused herself and felt appalled at what she had been thinking and
before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and her
eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the saviour lit by a
lamp she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments a painful
doubt filled her soul could the joy of love of earthly love for a
man be for her in her thoughts of marriage princess mary dreamed of
happiness and of children but her strongest most deeply hidden longing
was for earthly love the more she tried to hide this feeling from
others and even from herself the stronger it grew o god she
said how am i to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil 
how am i to renounce forever these vile fancies so as peacefully to
fulfill thy will and scarcely had she put that question than god
gave her the answer in her own heart desire nothing for thyself 
seek nothing be not anxious or envious man s future and thy own fate
must remain hidden from thee but live so that thou mayest be ready for
anything if it be god s will to prove thee in the duties of marriage 
be ready to fulfill his will with this consoling thought but
yet with a hope for the fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing 
princess mary sighed and having crossed herself went down thinking
neither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what
she would say what could all that matter in comparison with the will of
god without whose care not a hair of man s head can fall 





chapter iv

when princess mary came down prince vas li and his son were already
in the drawing room talking to the little princess and mademoiselle
bourienne when she entered with her heavy step treading on her heels 
the gentlemen and mademoiselle bourienne rose and the little princess 
indicating her to the gentlemen said voil marie princess mary
saw them all and saw them in detail she saw prince vas li s face 
serious for an instant at the sight of her but immediately smiling
again and the little princess curiously noting the impression
 marie produced on the visitors and she saw mademoiselle
bourienne with her ribbon and pretty face and her unusually animated
look which was fixed on him but him she could not see she only saw
something large brilliant and handsome moving toward her as she
entered the room prince vas li approached first and she kissed the
bold forehead that bent over her hand and answered his question by
saying that on the contrary she remembered him quite well then
anatole came up to her she still could not see him she only felt a
soft hand taking hers firmly and she touched with her lips a white
forehead over which was beautiful light brown hair smelling of pomade 
when she looked up at him she was struck by his beauty anatole stood
with his right thumb under a button of his uniform his chest expanded
and his back drawn in slightly swinging one foot and with his head a
little bent looked with beaming face at the princess without
speaking and evidently not thinking about her at all anatole was not
quick witted nor ready or eloquent in conversation but he had the
faculty so invaluable in society of composure and imperturbable
self possession if a man lacking in self confidence remains dumb on
a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of
such silence and an anxiety to find something to say the effect is
bad but anatole was dumb swung his foot and smilingly examined the
princess hair it was evident that he could be silent in this way for
a very long time if anyone finds this silence inconvenient let him
talk but i don t want to he seemed to say besides this in his
behavior to women anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in
them curiosity awe and even love a supercilious consciousness of
his own superiority it was as if he said to them i know you i know
you but why should i bother about you you d be only too glad of
course perhaps he did not really think this when he met women even
probably he did not for in general he thought very little but his
looks and manner gave that impression the princess felt this and as if
wishing to show him that she did not even dare expect to interest him 
she turned to his father the conversation was general and animated 
thanks to princess lise s voice and little downy lip that lifted over
her white teeth she met prince vas li with that playful manner often
employed by lively chatty people and consisting in the assumption
that between the person they so address and themselves there are some
semi private long established jokes and amusing reminiscences though
no such reminiscences really exist just as none existed in this case 
prince vas li readily adopted her tone and the little princess also
drew anatole whom she hardly knew into these amusing recollections of
things that had never occurred mademoiselle bourienne also shared them
and even princess mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in these
merry reminiscences 

 here at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to
ourselves dear prince said the little princess of course in
french to prince vas li it s not as at annette s receptions
where you always ran away you remember cette ch re annette 

 anna p vlovna 

 ah but you won t talk politics to me like annette 

 and our little tea table 

 oh yes 

 why is it you were never at annette s the little princess asked
anatole ah i know i know she said with a sly glance your
brother hippolyte told me about your goings on oh and she shook her
finger at him i have even heard of your doings in paris 

 and didn t hippolyte tell you asked prince vas li turning to
his son and seizing the little princess arm as if she would have run
away and he had just managed to catch her didn t he tell you how
he himself was pining for the dear princess and how she showed him the
door oh she is a pearl among women princess he added turning to
princess mary 

when paris was mentioned mademoiselle bourienne for her part seized the
opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections 

she took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since anatole
had left paris and how he had liked that city anatole answered the
frenchwoman very readily and looking at her with a smile talked to her
about her native land when he saw the pretty little bourienne anatole
came to the conclusion that he would not find bald hills dull either 
 not at all bad he thought examining her not at all bad that
little companion i hope she will bring her along with her when we re
married la petite est gentille 

 the little one is charming 

the old prince dressed leisurely in his study frowning and considering
what he was to do the coming of these visitors annoyed him what are
prince vas li and that son of his to me prince vas li is a shallow
braggart and his son no doubt is a fine specimen he grumbled to
himself what angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived
in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle one about
which he always deceived himself the question was whether he could ever
bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband the
prince never directly asked himself that question knowing beforehand
that he would have to answer it justly and justice clashed not only
with his feelings but with the very possibility of life life without
princess mary little as he seemed to value her was unthinkable to
him and why should she marry he thought to be unhappy for
certain there s lise married to andrew a better husband one would
think could hardly be found nowadays but is she contented with her
lot and who would marry marie for love plain and awkward they ll
take her for her connections and wealth are there no women living
unmarried and even the happier for it so thought prince bolk nski
while dressing and yet the question he was always putting off demanded
an immediate answer prince vas li had brought his son with the evident
intention of proposing and today or tomorrow he would probably ask
for an answer his birth and position in society were not bad well 
i ve nothing against it the prince said to himself but he must
be worthy of her and that is what we shall see 

 that is what we shall see that is what we shall see he added
aloud 

he entered the drawing room with his usual alert step glancing rapidly
round the company he noticed the change in the little princess 
dress mademoiselle bourienne s ribbon princess mary s unbecoming
coiffure mademoiselle bourienne s and anatole s smiles and the
loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation got herself
up like a fool he thought looking irritably at her she is
shameless and he ignores her 

he went straight up to prince vas li 

 well how d ye do how d ye do glad to see you 

 friendship laughs at distance began prince vas li in his usual
rapid self confident familiar tone here is my second son please
love and befriend him 

prince bolk nski surveyed anatole 

 fine young fellow fine young fellow he said well come and
kiss me and he offered his cheek 

anatole kissed the old man and looked at him with curiosity and perfect
composure waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had
told him to expect 

prince bolk nski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa
and drawing up an armchair for prince vas li pointed to it and began
questioning him about political affairs and news he seemed to listen
attentively to what prince vas li said but kept glancing at princess
mary 

 and so they are writing from potsdam already he said repeating
prince vas li s last words then rising he suddenly went up to his
daughter 

 is it for visitors you ve got yourself up like that eh said
he fine very fine you have done up your hair in this new way for
the visitors and before the visitors i tell you that in future you are
never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent 

 it was my fault mon p re interceded the little princess with a
blush 

 you must do as you please said prince bolk nski bowing to his
daughter in law but she need not make a fool of herself she s
plain enough as it is 

and he sat down again paying no more attention to his daughter who was
reduced to tears 

 on the contrary that coiffure suits the princess very well said
prince vas li 

 now you young prince what s your name said prince bolk nski 
turning to anatole come here let us talk and get acquainted 

 now the fun begins thought anatole sitting down with a smile
beside the old prince 

 well my dear boy i hear you ve been educated abroad not taught
to read and write by the deacon like your father and me now tell me 
my dear boy are you serving in the horse guards asked the old man 
scrutinizing anatole closely and intently 

 no i have been transferred to the line said anatole hardly able
to restrain his laughter 

 ah that s a good thing so my dear boy you wish to serve the
tsar and the country it is wartime such a fine fellow must serve 
well are you off to the front 

 no prince our regiment has gone to the front but i am attached 
what is it i am attached to papa said anatole turning to his
father with a laugh 

 a splendid soldier splendid what am i attached to ha ha 
ha laughed prince bolk nski and anatole laughed still louder 
suddenly prince bolk nski frowned 

 you may go he said to anatole 

anatole returned smiling to the ladies 

 and so you ve had him educated abroad prince vas li haven t
you said the old prince to prince vas li 

 i have done my best for him and i can assure you the education there
is much better than ours 

 yes everything is different nowadays everything is changed the
lad s a fine fellow a fine fellow well come with me now he took
prince vas li s arm and led him to his study as soon as they were
alone together prince vas li announced his hopes and wishes to the old
prince 

 well do you think i shall prevent her that i can t part from
her said the old prince angrily what an idea i m ready for it
tomorrow only let me tell you i want to know my son in law better you
know my principles everything aboveboard i will ask her tomorrow in
your presence if she is willing then he can stay on he can stay and
i ll see the old prince snorted let her marry it s all the
same to me he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting
from his son 

 i will tell you frankly said prince vas li in the tone of
a crafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so
keen sighted a companion you know you see right through people 
anatole is no genius but he is an honest goodhearted lad an excellent
son or kinsman 

 all right all right we ll see 

as always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time
without male society on anatole s appearance all the three women of
prince bolk nski s household felt that their life had not been real
till then their powers of reasoning feeling and observing immediately
increased tenfold and their life which seemed to have been passed in
darkness was suddenly lit up by a new brightness full of significance 

princess mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure the
handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed
all her attention he seemed to her kind brave determined manly and
magnanimous she felt convinced of that thousands of dreams of a future
family life continually rose in her imagination she drove them away and
tried to conceal them 

 but am i not too cold with him thought the princess i try
to be reserved because in the depth of my soul i feel too near to him
already but then he cannot know what i think of him and may imagine
that i do not like him 

and princess mary tried but could not manage to be cordial to her new
guest poor girl she s devilish ugly thought anatole 

mademoiselle bourienne also roused to great excitement by anatole s
arrival thought in another way of course she a handsome young woman
without any definite position without relations or even a country did
not intend to devote her life to serving prince bolk nski to reading
aloud to him and being friends with princess mary mademoiselle
bourienne had long been waiting for a russian prince who able to
appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain badly dressed 
ungainly russian princesses would fall in love with her and carry her
off and here at last was a russian prince mademoiselle bourienne knew
a story heard from her aunt but finished in her own way which she
liked to repeat to herself it was the story of a girl who had been
seduced and to whom her poor mother sa pauvre m re appeared and
reproached her for yielding to a man without being married mademoiselle
bourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this
story to him her seducer and now he a real russian prince had
appeared he would carry her away and then sa pauvre m re would appear
and he would marry her so her future shaped itself in mademoiselle
bourienne s head at the very time she was talking to anatole about
paris it was not calculation that guided her she did not even for a
moment consider what she should do but all this had long been familiar
to her and now that anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around
him and she wished and tried to please him as much as possible 

the little princess like an old war horse that hears the trumpet 
unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition prepared for the
familiar gallop of coquetry without any ulterior motive or any
struggle but with na ve and lighthearted gaiety 

although in female society anatole usually assumed the role of a man
tired of being run after by women his vanity was flattered by the
spectacle of his power over these three women besides that he was
beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative mademoiselle bourienne
that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great
suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions 

after tea the company went into the sitting room and princess mary was
asked to play on the clavichord anatole laughing and in high spirits 
came and leaned on his elbows facing her and beside mademoiselle
bourienne princess mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion 
her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and
the look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic but
anatole s expression though his eyes were fixed on her referred not
to her but to the movements of mademoiselle bourienne s little
foot which he was then touching with his own under the clavichord 
mademoiselle bourienne was also looking at princess mary and in her
lovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and hope that was also new
to the princess 

 how she loves me thought princess mary how happy i am now 
and how happy i may be with such a friend and such a husband husband 
can it be possible she thought not daring to look at his face but
still feeling his eyes gazing at her 

in the evening after supper when all were about to retire anatole
kissed princess mary s hand she did not know how she found the
courage but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near
to her shortsighted eyes turning from princess mary he went up and
kissed mademoiselle bourienne s hand this was not etiquette but
then he did everything so simply and with such assurance mademoiselle
bourienne flushed and gave the princess a frightened look 

 what delicacy thought the princess is it possible that
am lie mademoiselle bourienne thinks i could be jealous of her 
and not value her pure affection and devotion to me she went up
to her and kissed her warmly anatole went up to kiss the little
princess hand 

 no no no when your father writes to tell me that you are behaving
well i will give you my hand to kiss not till then she said and
smilingly raising a finger at him she left the room 





chapter v

they all separated but except anatole who fell asleep as soon as he
got into bed all kept awake a long time that night 

 is he really to be my husband this stranger who is so kind yes 
kind that is the chief thing thought princess mary and fear which
she had seldom experienced came upon her she feared to look round it
seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the
dark corner and this someone was he the devil and he was also this
man with the white forehead black eyebrows and red lips 

she rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room 

mademoiselle bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long
time that evening vainly expecting someone now smiling at someone now
working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre m re
rebuking her for her fall 

the little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made 
she could not lie either on her face or on her side every position was
awkward and uncomfortable and her burden oppressed her now more than
ever because anatole s presence had vividly recalled to her the time
when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay she
sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and katie sleepy
and disheveled beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third
time muttering to herself 

 i told you it was all lumps and holes the little princess
repeated i should be glad enough to fall asleep so it s not my
fault and her voice quivered like that of a child about to cry 

the old prince did not sleep either t khon half asleep heard him
pacing angrily about and snorting the old prince felt as though he
had been insulted through his daughter the insult was the more pointed
because it concerned not himself but another his daughter whom he
loved more than himself he kept telling himself that he would consider
the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act but
instead of that he only excited himself more and more 

 the first man that turns up she forgets her father and everything
else runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike
herself glad to throw her father over and she knew i should notice
it fr fr fr and don t i see that that idiot had eyes only for
bourienne i shall have to get rid of her and how is it she has not
pride enough to see it if she has no pride for herself she might at
least have some for my sake she must be shown that the blockhead thinks
nothing of her and looks only at bourienne no she has no pride but
i ll let her see 

the old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a
mistake and that anatole meant to flirt with mademoiselle bourienne 
princess mary s self esteem would be wounded and his point not to
be parted from her would be gained so pacifying himself with this
thought he called t khon and began to undress 

 what devil brought them here thought he while t khon was
putting the nightshirt over his dried up old body and gray haired chest 
 i never invited them they came to disturb my life and there is not
much of it left 

 devil take em he muttered while his head was still covered by
the shirt 

t khon knew his master s habit of sometimes thinking aloud and
therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of
the face that emerged from the shirt 

 gone to bed asked the prince 

t khon like all good valets instinctively knew the direction of his
master s thoughts he guessed that the question referred to prince
vas li and his son 

 they have gone to bed and put out their lights your excellency 

 no good no good said the prince rapidly and thrusting his
feet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing
gown he went to the couch on which he slept 

though no words had passed between anatole and mademoiselle bourienne 
they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance 
up to the appearance of the pauvre m re they understood that they had
much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an
opportunity since morning to meet one another alone when princess mary
went to her father s room at the usual hour mademoiselle bourienne
and anatole met in the conservatory 

princess mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation 
it seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be
decided that day but that they also knew what she thought about it she
read this in t khon s face and in that of prince vas li s valet 
who made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot
water 

the old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of
his daughter that morning princess mary well knew this painstaking
expression of her father s his face wore that expression when his
dry hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in
arithmetic when rising from his chair he would walk away from her 
repeating in a low voice the same words several times over 

he came to the point at once treating her ceremoniously 

 i have had a proposition made me concerning you he said with an
unnatural smile i expect you have guessed that prince vas li has
not come and brought his pupil with him for some reason prince
bolk nski referred to anatole as a pupil for the sake of my
beautiful eyes last night a proposition was made me on your account
and as you know my principles i refer it to you 

 how am i to understand you mon p re said the princess growing
pale and then blushing 

 how understand me cried her father angrily prince vas li
finds you to his taste as a daughter in law and makes a proposal to you
on his pupil s behalf that s how it s to be understood how
understand it and i ask you 

 i do not know what you think father whispered the princess 

 i i what of me leave me out of the question i m not going to
get married what about you that s what i want to know 

the princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval 
but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be
decided now or never she lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze
under which she felt that she could not think but would only be able to
submit from habit and she said i wish only to do your will but if
i had to express my own desire she had no time to finish the old
prince interrupted her 

 that s admirable he shouted he will take you with your
dowry and take mademoiselle bourienne into the bargain she ll be the
wife while you 

the prince stopped he saw the effect these words had produced on his
daughter she lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears 

 now then now then i m only joking he said remember this 
princess i hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to
choose i give you freedom only remember that your life s happiness
depends on your decision never mind me 

 but i do not know father 

 there s no need to talk he receives his orders and will marry you
or anybody but you are free to choose go to your room think it
over and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence yes or no 
i know you will pray over it well pray if you like but you had better
think it over go yes or no yes or no yes or no he still shouted
when the princess as if lost in a fog had already staggered out of the
study 

her fate was decided and happily decided but what her father had said
about mademoiselle bourienne was dreadful it was untrue to be sure but
still it was terrible and she could not help thinking of it she was
going straight on through the conservatory neither seeing nor hearing
anything when suddenly the well known whispering of mademoiselle
bourienne aroused her she raised her eyes and two steps away saw
anatole embracing the frenchwoman and whispering something to her with
a horrified expression on his handsome face anatole looked at princess
mary but did not at once take his arm from the waist of mademoiselle
bourienne who had not yet seen her 

 who s that why wait a moment anatole s face seemed to say 
princess mary looked at them in silence she could not understand it at
last mademoiselle bourienne gave a scream and ran away anatole bowed to
princess mary with a gay smile as if inviting her to join in a laugh at
this strange incident and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door
that led to his own apartments 

an hour later t khon came to call princess mary to the old prince 
he added that prince vas li was also there when t khon came to her
princess mary was sitting on the sofa in her room holding the weeping
mademoiselle bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair the
princess beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were
looking with tender affection and pity at mademoiselle bourienne s
pretty face 

 no princess i have lost your affection forever said
mademoiselle bourienne 

 why i love you more than ever said princess mary and i will
try to do all i can for your happiness 

 but you despise me you who are so pure can never understand being so
carried away by passion oh only my poor mother 

 i quite understand answered princess mary with a sad smile 
 calm yourself my dear i will go to my father she said and went
out 

prince vas li with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox
in his hand was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face 
as if stirred to his heart s core and himself regretting and laughing
at his own sensibility when princess mary entered he hurriedly took a
pinch of snuff 

 ah my dear my dear he began rising and taking her by both
hands then sighing he added my son s fate is in your hands 
decide my dear good gentle marie whom i have always loved as a
daughter 

he drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye 

 fr fr snorted prince bolk nski the prince is making a
proposition to you in his pupil s i mean his son s name do you
wish or not to be prince anatole kur gin s wife reply yes or no 
he shouted and then i shall reserve the right to state my opinion
also yes my opinion and only my opinion added prince bolk nski 
turning to prince vas li and answering his imploring look yes or
no 

 my desire is never to leave you father never to separate my
life from yours i don t wish to marry she answered positively 
glancing at prince vas li and at her father with her beautiful eyes 

 humbug nonsense humbug humbug humbug cried prince bolk nski 
frowning and taking his daughter s hand he did not kiss her but only
bending his forehead to hers just touched it and pressed her hand so
that she winced and uttered a cry 

prince vas li rose 

 my dear i must tell you that this is a moment i shall never never
forget but my dear will you not give us a little hope of touching
this heart so kind and generous say perhaps the future is so
long say perhaps 

 prince what i have said is all there is in my heart i thank you for
the honor but i shall never be your son s wife 

 well so that s finished my dear fellow i am very glad to have
seen you very glad go back to your rooms princess go said
the old prince very very glad to have seen you repeated he 
embracing prince vas li 

 my vocation is a different one thought princess mary my
vocation is to be happy with another kind of happiness the happiness
of love and self sacrifice and cost what it may i will arrange
poor am lie s happiness she loves him so passionately and so
passionately repents i will do all i can to arrange the match between
them if he is not rich i will give her the means i will ask my
father and andrew i shall be so happy when she is his wife she is so
unfortunate a stranger alone helpless and oh god how passionately
she must love him if she could so far forget herself perhaps i might
have done the same thought princess mary 





chapter vi

it was long since the rost vs had news of nicholas not till midwinter
was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his son s
handwriting on receiving it he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm and
haste trying to escape notice closed the door and began to read the
letter 

anna mikh ylovna who always knew everything that passed in the house 
on hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into the room and
found the count with it in his hand sobbing and laughing at the same
time 

anna mikh ylovna though her circumstances had improved was still
living with the rost vs 

 my dear friend said she in a tone of pathetic inquiry prepared
to sympathize in any way 

the count sobbed yet more 

 nik lenka a letter wa a s wounded my darling
boy the countess promoted to be an officer thank god how
tell the little countess 

anna mikh ylovna sat down beside him with her own handkerchief wiped
the tears from his eyes and from the letter then having dried her
own eyes she comforted the count and decided that at dinner and till
teatime she would prepare the countess and after tea with god s
help would inform her 

at dinner anna mikh ylovna talked the whole time about the war news
and about nik lenka twice asked when the last letter had been received
from him though she knew that already and remarked that they might
very likely be getting a letter from him that day each time that these
hints began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at
the count and at anna mikh ylovna the latter very adroitly turned
the conversation to insignificant matters nat sha who of the whole
family was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of
intonation look and expression pricked up her ears from the beginning
of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her
father and anna mikh ylovna that it had something to do with her
brother and that anna mikh ylovna was preparing them for it bold as
she was nat sha who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything
relating to nik lenka did not venture to ask any questions at dinner 
but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her
chair regardless of her governess remarks after dinner she rushed
headlong after anna mikh ylovna and dashing at her flung herself on
her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room 

 auntie darling do tell me what it is 

 nothing my dear 

 no dearest sweet one honey i won t give up i know you know
something 

anna mikh ylovna shook her head 

 you are a little slyboots she said 

 a letter from nik lenka i m sure of it exclaimed nat sha 
reading confirmation in anna mikh ylovna s face 

 but for god s sake be careful you know how it may affect your
mamma 

 i will i will only tell me you won t then i will go and tell at
once 

anna mikh ylovna in a few words told her the contents of the letter 
on condition that she should tell no one 

 no on my true word of honor said nat sha crossing herself 
 i won t tell anyone and she ran off at once to s nya 

 nik lenka wounded a letter she announced in gleeful
triumph 

 nicholas was all s nya said instantly turning white 

nat sha seeing the impression the news of her brother s wound
produced on s nya felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the
news 

she rushed to s nya hugged her and began to cry 

 a little wound but he has been made an officer he is well now he
wrote himself said she through her tears 

 there now it s true that all you women are crybabies remarked
p tya pacing the room with large resolute strides now i m very
glad very glad indeed that my brother has distinguished himself so 
you are all blubberers and understand nothing 

nat sha smiled through her tears 

 you haven t read the letter asked s nya 

 no but she said that it was all over and that he s now an
officer 

 thank god said s nya crossing herself but perhaps she
deceived you let us go to mamma 

p tya paced the room in silence for a time 

 if i d been in nik lenka s place i would have killed even more
of those frenchmen he said what nasty brutes they are i d
have killed so many that there d have been a heap of them 

 hold your tongue p tya what a goose you are 

 i m not a goose but they are who cry about trifles said
p tya 

 do you remember him nat sha suddenly asked after a moment s
silence 

s nya smiled 

 do i remember nicholas 

 no s nya but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly 
remember everything said nat sha with an expressive gesture 
evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning i
remember nik lenka too i remember him well she said but i
don t remember bor s i don t remember him a bit 

 what you don t remember bor s asked s nya in surprise 

 it s not that i don t remember i know what he is like but not
as i remember nik lenka him i just shut my eyes and remember 
but bor s no she shut her eyes no there s nothing at
all 

 oh nat sha said s nya looking ecstatically and earnestly at
her friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant
to say and as if she were saying it to someone else with whom joking
was out of the question i am in love with your brother once for all
and whatever may happen to him or to me shall never cease to love him
as long as i live 

nat sha looked at s nya with wondering and inquisitive eyes and said
nothing she felt that s nya was speaking the truth that there was
such love as s nya was speaking of but nat sha had not yet felt
anything like it she believed it could be but did not understand it 

 shall you write to him she asked 

s nya became thoughtful the question of how to write to nicholas and
whether she ought to write tormented her now that he was already an
officer and a wounded hero would it be right to remind him of herself
and as it might seem of the obligations to her he had taken on
himself 

 i don t know i think if he writes i will write too she said 
blushing 

 and you won t feel ashamed to write to him 

s nya smiled 

 no 

 and i should be ashamed to write to bor s i m not going to 

 why should you be ashamed 

 well i don t know it s awkward and would make me ashamed 

 and i know why she d be ashamed said p tya offended by
nat sha s previous remark it s because she was in love with
that fat one in spectacles that was how p tya described his
namesake the new count bez khov and now she s in love with that
singer he meant nat sha s italian singing master that s
why she s ashamed 

 p tya you re a stupid said nat sha 

 not more stupid than you madam said the nine year old p tya 
with the air of an old brigadier 

the countess had been prepared by anna mikh ylovna s hints at dinner 
on retiring to her own room she sat in an armchair her eyes fixed on a
miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox while the tears
kept coming into her eyes anna mikh ylovna with the letter came on
tiptoe to the countess door and paused 

 don t come in she said to the old count who was following her 
 come later and she went in closing the door behind her 

the count put his ear to the keyhole and listened 

at first he heard the sound of indifferent voices then anna
mikh ylovna s voice alone in a long speech then a cry then silence 
then both voices together with glad intonations and then footsteps 
anna mikh ylovna opened the door her face wore the proud expression
of a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the
public to appreciate his skill 

 it is done she said to the count pointing triumphantly to the
countess who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and
in the other the letter and pressing them alternately to her lips 

when she saw the count she stretched out her arms to him embraced his
bald head over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait 
and in order to press them again to her lips she slightly pushed away
the bald head v ra nat sha s nya and p tya now entered the room 
and the reading of the letter began after a brief description of
the campaign and the two battles in which he had taken part and his
promotion nicholas said that he kissed his father s and mother s
hands asking for their blessing and that he kissed v ra nat sha and
p tya besides that he sent greetings to monsieur schelling madame
schoss and his old nurse and asked them to kiss for him dear
s nya whom he loved and thought of just the same as ever when she
heard this s nya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and unable
to bear the looks turned upon her ran away into the dancing hall 
whirled round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon 
and flushed and smiling plumped down on the floor the countess was
crying 

 why are you crying mamma asked v ra from all he says one
should be glad and not cry 

this was quite true but the count the countess and nat sha looked
at her reproachfully and who is it she takes after thought the
countess 

nicholas letter was read over hundreds of times and those who were
considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess for she
did not let it out of her hands the tutors came and the nurses and
dm tri and several acquaintances and the countess reread the letter
each time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh
proofs of nik lenka s virtues how strange how extraordinary how
joyful it seemed that her son the scarcely perceptible motion of whose
tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her that son about whom
she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count that son who
had first learned to say pear and then granny that this son
should now be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings a manly
warrior doing some kind of man s work of his own without help or
guidance the universal experience of ages showing that children do
grow imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood did not exist for the
countess her son s growth toward manhood at each of its stages 
had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the
millions of human beings who grew up in the same way as twenty
years before it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived
somewhere under her heart would ever cry suck her breast and begin to
speak so now she could not believe that that little creature could be
this strong brave man this model son and officer that judging by this
letter he now was 

 what a style how charmingly he describes said she reading the
descriptive part of the letter and what a soul not a word about
himself not a word about some den sov or other though he himself 
i dare say is braver than any of them he says nothing about his
sufferings what a heart how like him it is and how he has remembered
everybody not forgetting anyone i always said when he was only so
high i always said 

for more than a week preparations were being made rough drafts of
letters to nicholas from all the household were written and copied out 
while under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of the
count money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment
of the newly commissioned officer were collected anna mikh ylovna 
practical woman that she was had even managed by favor with army
authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself
and her son she had opportunities of sending her letters to the grand
duke constantine p vlovich who commanded the guards the rost vs
supposed that the russian guards abroad was quite a definite address 
and that if a letter reached the grand duke in command of the guards
there was no reason why it should not reach the p vlograd regiment 
which was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood and so it was
decided to send the letters and money by the grand duke s courier to
bor s and bor s was to forward them to nicholas the letters were from
the old count the countess p tya v ra nat sha and s nya and
finally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various other
things the old count sent to his son 





chapter vii

on the twelfth of november kut zov s active army in camp before
olm tz was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two emperors the
russian and the austrian the guards just arrived from russia spent
the night ten miles from olm tz and next morning were to come straight
to the review reaching the field at olm tz by ten o clock 

that day nicholas rost v received a letter from bor s telling him
that the ism ylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from
olm tz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for
him rost v was particularly in need of money now that the troops 
after their active service were stationed near olm tz and the camp
swarmed with well provisioned sutlers and austrian jews offering
all sorts of tempting wares the p vlograds held feast after feast 
celebrating awards they had received for the campaign and made
expeditions to olm tz to visit a certain caroline the hungarian 
who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses 
rost v who had just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought
den sov s horse bedouin was in debt all round to his comrades and
the sutlers on receiving bor s letter he rode with a fellow officer
to olm tz dined there drank a bottle of wine and then set off alone
to the guards camp to find his old playmate rost v had not yet had
time to get his uniform he had on a shabby cadet jacket decorated with
a soldier s cross equally shabby cadet s riding breeches lined with
worn leather and an officer s saber with a sword knot the don horse
he was riding was one he had bought from a cossack during the campaign 
and he wore a crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his
head as he rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress bor s
and all his comrades of the guards by his appearance that of a
fighting hussar who had been under fire 

the guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip parading
their cleanliness and discipline they had come by easy stages their
knapsacks conveyed on carts and the austrian authorities had provided
excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place the regiments
had entered and left the town with their bands playing and by the grand
duke s orders the men had marched all the way in step a practice on
which the guards prided themselves the officers on foot and at their
proper posts bor s had been quartered and had marched all the
way with berg who was already in command of a company berg who had
obtained his captaincy during the campaign had gained the confidence of
his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money
matters very satisfactorily bor s during the campaign had made the
acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him and by
a letter of recommendation he had brought from pierre had become
acquainted with prince andrew bolk nski through whom he hoped to
obtain a post on the commander in chief s staff berg and bor s 
having rested after yesterday s march were sitting clean and neatly
dressed at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them 
playing chess berg held a smoking pipe between his knees bor s in
the accurate way characteristic of him was building a little pyramid of
chessmen with his delicate white fingers while awaiting berg s move 
and watched his opponent s face evidently thinking about the game as
he always thought only of whatever he was engaged on 

 well how are you going to get out of that he remarked 

 we ll try to replied berg touching a pawn and then removing
his hand 

at that moment the door opened 

 here he is at last shouted rost v and berg too oh you
petisenfans allay cushay dormir he exclaimed imitating his russian
nurse s french at which he and bor s used to laugh long ago 

 dear me how you have changed 

bor s rose to meet rost v but in doing so did not omit to steady and
replace some chessmen that were falling he was about to embrace his
friend but nicholas avoided him with that peculiar feeling of youth 
that dread of beaten tracks and wish to express itself in a manner
different from that of its elders which is often insincere nicholas
wished to do something special on meeting his friend he wanted to pinch
him push him do anything but kiss him a thing everybody did but
notwithstanding this bor s embraced him in a quiet friendly way and
kissed him three times 

they had not met for nearly half a year and being at the age when young
men take their first steps on life s road each saw immense changes in
the other quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken
those first steps both had changed greatly since they last met and both
were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them 

 oh you damned dandies clean and fresh as if you d been to a fete 
not like us sinners of the line cried rost v with martial swagger
and with baritone notes in his voice new to bor s pointing to his own
mud bespattered breeches the german landlady hearing rost v s loud
voice popped her head in at the door 

 eh is she pretty he asked with a wink 

 why do you shout so you ll frighten them said bor s i did
not expect you today he added i only sent you the note yesterday
by bolk nski an adjutant of kut zov s who s a friend of mine 
i did not think he would get it to you so quickly well how are you 
been under fire already asked bor s 

without answering rost v shook the soldier s cross of st george
fastened to the cording of his uniform and indicating a bandaged arm 
glanced at berg with a smile 

 as you see he said 

 indeed yes yes said bor s with a smile and we too have
had a splendid march you know of course that his imperial highness
rode with our regiment all the time so that we had every comfort and
every advantage what receptions we had in poland what dinners and
balls i can t tell you and the tsar vich was very gracious to all
our officers 

and the two friends told each other of their doings the one of his
hussar revels and life in the fighting line the other of the pleasures
and advantages of service under members of the imperial family 

 oh you guards said rost v i say send for some wine 

bor s made a grimace 

 if you really want it said he 

he went to his bed drew a purse from under the clean pillow and sent
for wine 

 yes and i have some money and a letter to give you he added 

rost v took the letter and throwing the money on the sofa put both
arms on the table and began to read after reading a few lines he
glanced angrily at berg then meeting his eyes hid his face behind the
letter 

 well they ve sent you a tidy sum said berg eying the heavy
purse that sank into the sofa as for us count we get along on our
pay i can tell you for myself 

 i say berg my dear fellow said rost v when you get a
letter from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk
everything over with and i happen to be there i ll go at once to
be out of your way do go somewhere anywhere to the devil he
exclaimed and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking
amiably into his face evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his
words he added don t be hurt my dear fellow you know i speak
from my heart as to an old acquaintance 

 oh don t mention it count i quite understand said berg 
getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice 

 go across to our hosts they invited you added bor s 

berg put on the cleanest of coats without a spot or speck of dust 
stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples
upwards in the way affected by the emperor alexander and having
assured himself from the way rost v looked at it that his coat had been
noticed left the room with a pleasant smile 

 oh dear what a beast i am muttered rost v as he read the
letter 

 why 

 oh what a pig i am not to have written and to have given them
such a fright oh what a pig i am he repeated flushing suddenly 
 well have you sent gabriel for some wine all right let s have
some 

in the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation
to bagrati n which the old countess at anna mikh ylovna s advice had
obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son asking him to take
it to its destination and make use of it 

 what nonsense much i need it said rost v throwing the letter
under the table 

 why have you thrown that away asked bor s 

 it is some letter of recommendation what the devil do i want it
for 

 why what the devil said bor s picking it up and reading
the address this letter would be of great use to you 

 i want nothing and i won t be anyone s adjutant 

 why not inquired bor s 

 it s a lackey s job 

 you are still the same dreamer i see remarked bor s shaking
his head 

 and you re still the same diplomatist but that s not the
point come how are you asked rost v 

 well as you see so far everything s all right but i confess i
should much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front 

 why 

 because when once a man starts on military service he should try to
make as successful a career of it as possible 

 oh that s it said rost v evidently thinking of something
else 

he looked intently and inquiringly into his friend s eyes evidently
trying in vain to find the answer to some question 

old gabriel brought in the wine 

 shouldn t we now send for berg asked bor s he would drink
with you i can t 

 well send for him and how do you get on with that german 
asked rost v with a contemptuous smile 

 he is a very very nice honest and pleasant fellow answered
bor s 

again rost v looked intently into bor s eyes and sighed berg
returned and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three
officers became animated the guardsmen told rost v of their march and
how they had been made much of in russia poland and abroad they spoke
of the sayings and doings of their commander the grand duke and told
stories of his kindness and irascibility berg as usual kept silent
when the subject did not relate to himself but in connection with the
stories of the grand duke s quick temper he related with gusto how in
galicia he had managed to deal with the grand duke when the latter
made a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of
a movement with a pleasant smile berg related how the grand duke
had ridden up to him in a violent passion shouting arnauts 
 arnauts was the tsar vich s favorite expression when he was in
a rage and called for the company commander 

 would you believe it count i was not at all alarmed because i knew
i was right without boasting you know i may say that i know the army
orders by heart and know the regulations as well as i do the lord s
prayer so count there never is any negligence in my company and
so my conscience was at ease i came forward berg stood up and
showed how he presented himself with his hand to his cap and really
it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and
self complacency than his did well he stormed at me as the saying
is stormed and stormed and stormed it was not a matter of life but
rather of death as the saying is albanians and devils 
and to siberia said berg with a sagacious smile i knew i
was in the right so i kept silent was not that best count hey 
are you dumb he shouted still i remained silent and what do you
think count the next day it was not even mentioned in the orders of
the day that s what keeping one s head means that s the way 
count said berg lighting his pipe and emitting rings of smoke 

 yes that was fine said rost v smiling 

but bor s noticed that he was preparing to make fun of berg and
skillfully changed the subject he asked him to tell them how and where
he got his wound this pleased rost v and he began talking about it 
and as he went on became more and more animated he told them of his
sch n grabern affair just as those who have taken part in a battle
generally do describe it that is as they would like it to have been 
as they have heard it described by others and as sounds well but not
at all as it really was rost v was a truthful young man and would on
no account have told a deliberate lie he began his story meaning to
tell everything just as it happened but imperceptibly involuntarily 
and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood if he had told the truth to his
hearers who like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had
formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear
just such a story they would either not have believed him or still
worse would have thought that rost v was himself to blame since what
generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened
to him he could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and
that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as
he could from a frenchman into the wood besides to tell everything as
it really happened it would have been necessary to make an effort of
will to tell only what happened it is very difficult to tell the truth 
and young people are rarely capable of it his hearers expected a story
of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement he had flown like
a storm at the square cut his way in slashed right and left how his
saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted and so on and so he
told them all that 

in the middle of his story just as he was saying you cannot imagine
what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack prince
andrew whom bor s was expecting entered the room prince andrew who
liked to help young men was flattered by being asked for his assistance
and being well disposed toward bor s who had managed to please him the
day before he wished to do what the young man wanted having been sent
with papers from kut zov to the tsar vich he looked in on bor s 
hoping to find him alone when he came in and saw an hussar of the line
recounting his military exploits prince andrew could not endure
that sort of man he gave bor s a pleasant smile frowned as with
half closed eyes he looked at rost v bowed slightly and wearily and
sat down languidly on the sofa he felt it unpleasant to have dropped
in on bad company rost v flushed up on noticing this but he did not
care this was a mere stranger glancing however at bor s he saw
that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line 

in spite of prince andrew s disagreeable ironical tone in spite of
the contempt with which rost v from his fighting army point of view 
regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer
was evidently one rost v felt confused blushed and became silent 
bor s inquired what news there might be on the staff and what without
indiscretion one might ask about our plans 

 we shall probably advance replied bolk nski evidently reluctant
to say more in the presence of a stranger 

berg took the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as was
rumored the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be
doubled to this prince andrew answered with a smile that he could
give no opinion on such an important government order and berg laughed
gaily 

 as to your business prince andrew continued addressing bor s 
 we will talk of it later and he looked round at rost v come
to me after the review and we will do what is possible 

and having glanced round the room prince andrew turned to rost v 
whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to
anger he did not condescend to notice and said i think you were
talking of the sch n grabern affair were you there 

 i was there said rost v angrily as if intending to insult the
aide de camp 

bolk nski noticed the hussar s state of mind and it amused him with
a slightly contemptuous smile he said yes there are many stories
now told about that affair 

 yes stories repeated rost v loudly looking with eyes suddenly
grown furious now at bor s now at bolk nski yes many stories 
but our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy s
fire our stories have some weight not like the stories of those
fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything 

 of whom you imagine me to be one said prince andrew with a quiet
and particularly amiable smile 

a strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this man s
self possession mingled at that moment in rost v s soul 

 i am not talking about you he said i don t know you and 
frankly i don t want to i am speaking of the staff in general 

 and i will tell you this prince andrew interrupted in a tone of
quiet authority you wish to insult me and i am ready to agree with
you that it would be very easy to do so if you haven t sufficient
self respect but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen 
in a day or two we shall all have to take part in a greater and more
serious duel and besides drubetsk y who says he is an old friend
of yours is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to
displease you however he added rising you know my name and
where to find me but don t forget that i do not regard either myself
or you as having been at all insulted and as a man older than you my
advice is to let the matter drop well then on friday after the review
i shall expect you drubetsk y au revoir exclaimed prince andrew 
and with a bow to them both he went out 

only when prince andrew was gone did rost v think of what he ought to
have said and he was still more angry at having omitted to say it he
ordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave of bor s rode
home should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected
adjutant or really let the matter drop was the question that worried
him all the way he thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at
seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered by
his pistol and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knew
there was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that very
adjutant whom he so hated 





chapter viii

the day after rost v had been to see bor s a review was held of the
austrian and russian troops both those freshly arrived from russia and
those who had been campaigning under kut zov the two emperors 
the russian with his heir the tsar vich and the austrian with the
archduke inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men 

from early morning the smart clean troops were on the move forming up
on the field before the fortress now thousands of feet and bayonets
moved and halted at the officers command turned with banners flying 
formed up at intervals and wheeled round other similar masses of
infantry in different uniforms now was heard the rhythmic beat of
hoofs and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue red and green braided
uniforms with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black roan 
or gray horses then again spreading out with the brazen clatter of the
polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with
the smell of linstocks came the artillery which crawled between the
infantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position not only the
generals in full parade uniforms with their thin or thick waists drawn
in to the utmost their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars and
wearing scarves and all their decorations not only the elegant pomaded
officers but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face and
his weapons clean and polished to the utmost and every horse groomed
till its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane lay
smooth felt that no small matter was happening but an important and
solemn affair every general and every soldier was conscious of his own
insignificance aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men and
yet at the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of that
enormous whole 

from early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten
o clock all had been brought into due order the ranks were drawn
up on the vast field the whole army was extended in three lines the
cavalry in front behind it the artillery and behind that again the
infantry 

a space like a street was left between each two lines of troops the
three parts of that army were sharply distinguished kut zov s
fighting army with the p vlograds on the right flank of the front 
those recently arrived from russia both guards and regiments of the
line and the austrian troops but they all stood in the same lines 
under one command and in a like order 

like wind over leaves ran an excited whisper they re coming 
they re coming alarmed voices were heard and a stir of final
preparation swept over all the troops 

from the direction of olm tz in front of them a group was seen
approaching and at that moment though the day was still a light gust
of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the
lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs it
looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its
joy at the approach of the emperors one voice was heard shouting 
 eyes front then like the crowing of cocks at sunrise this was
repeated by others from various sides and all became silent 

in the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard this
was the emperors suites the emperors rode up to the flank and the
trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march it
seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing but as if the army
itself rejoicing at the emperors approach had naturally burst into
music amid these sounds only the youthful kindly voice of the emperor
alexander was clearly heard he gave the words of greeting and the
first regiment roared hurrah so deafeningly continuously and
joyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and the
immensity of the power they constituted 

rost v standing in the front lines of kut zov s army which the tsar
approached first experienced the same feeling as every other man in
that army a feeling of self forgetfulness a proud consciousness of
might and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this
triumph 

he felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass and he
himself an insignificant atom in it would go through fire and water 
commit crime die or perform deeds of highest heroism and so he could
not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word 

 hurrah hurrah hurrah thundered from all sides one regiment
after another greeting the tsar with the strains of the march and then
 hurrah then the general march and again hurrah hurrah 
growing ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar 

till the tsar reached it each regiment in its silence and immobility
seemed like a lifeless body but as soon as he came up it became alive 
its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had
already passed through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices 
amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to
stone hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but
symmetrically and above all freely and in front of them two men the
emperors upon them the undivided tensely passionate attention of that
whole mass of men was concentrated 

the handsome young emperor alexander in the uniform of the horse
guards wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back with his
pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice attracted everyone s
attention 

rost v was not far from the trumpeters and with his keen sight had
recognized the tsar and watched his approach when he was within twenty
paces and nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his
handsome happy young face he experienced a feeling of tenderness
and ecstasy such as he had never before known every trait and every
movement of the tsar s seemed to him enchanting 

stopping in front of the p vlograds the tsar said something in french
to the austrian emperor and smiled 

seeing that smile rost v involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still
stronger flow of love for his sovereign he longed to show that love in
some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry the tsar
called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him 

 oh god what would happen to me if the emperor spoke to me 
thought rost v i should die of happiness 

the tsar addressed the officers also i thank you all gentlemen i
thank you with my whole heart to rost v every word sounded like a
voice from heaven how gladly would he have died at once for his tsar 

 you have earned the st george s standards and will be worthy of
them 

 oh to die to die for him thought rost v 

the tsar said something more which rost v did not hear and the
soldiers straining their lungs shouted hurrah 

rost v too bending over his saddle shouted hurrah with all his
might feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout if
only to express his rapture fully 

the tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided 

 how can the emperor be undecided thought rost v but then even
this indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting like everything
else the tsar did 

that hesitation lasted only an instant the tsar s foot in the narrow
pointed boot then fashionable touched the groin of the bobtailed bay
mare he rode his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins and he
moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides de camp 
farther and farther he rode away stopping at other regiments till at
last only his white plumes were visible to rost v from amid the suites
that surrounded the emperors 

among the gentlemen of the suite rost v noticed bolk nski sitting
his horse indolently and carelessly rost v recalled their quarrel of
yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought
not to challenge bolk nski of course not he now thought is
it worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment at a time of such
love such rapture and such self sacrifice what do any of our quarrels
and affronts matter i love and forgive everybody now 

when the emperor had passed nearly all the regiments the troops began
a ceremonial march past him and rost v on bedouin recently purchased
from den sov rode past too at the rear of his squadron that is 
alone and in full view of the emperor 

before he reached him rost v who was a splendid horseman spurred
bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the
animal went when excited bending his foaming muzzle to his chest his
tail extended bedouin as if also conscious of the emperor s eye
upon him passed splendidly lifting his feet with a high and graceful
action as if flying through the air without touching the ground 

rost v himself his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling
himself one with his horse rode past the emperor with a frowning but
blissful face like a vewy devil as den sov expressed it 

 fine fellows the p vlograds remarked the emperor 

 my god how happy i should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire
this instant thought rost v 

when the review was over the newly arrived officers and also
kut zov s collected in groups and began to talk about the awards 
about the austrians and their uniforms about their lines about
bonaparte and how badly the latter would fare now especially if the
essen corps arrived and prussia took our side 

but the talk in every group was chiefly about the emperor alexander his
every word and movement was described with ecstasy 

they all had but one wish to advance as soon as possible against the
enemy under the emperor s command commanded by the emperor himself
they could not fail to vanquish anyone be it whom it might so thought
rost v and most of the officers after the review 

all were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battles
would have made them 





chapter ix

the day after the review bor s in his best uniform and with his
comrade berg s best wishes for success rode to olm tz to see
bolk nski wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself
the best post he could preferably that of adjutant to some important
personage a position in the army which seemed to him most attractive 
 it is all very well for rost v whose father sends him ten thousand
rubles at a time to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not
be anyone s lackey but i who have nothing but my brains have to
make a career and must not miss opportunities but must avail myself of
them he reflected 

he did not find prince andrew in olm tz that day but the appearance of
the town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed
and the two emperors were living with their suites households and
courts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher world 

he knew no one and despite his smart guardsman s uniform all these
exalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages
with their plumes ribbons and medals both courtiers and military
men seemed so immeasurably above him an insignificant officer of the
guards that they not only did not wish to but simply could not be
aware of his existence at the quarters of the commander in chief 
kut zov where he inquired for bolk nski all the adjutants and even
the orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a
great many officers like him were always coming there and that everybody
was heartily sick of them in spite of this or rather because of
it next day november 15 after dinner he again went to olm tz and 
entering the house occupied by kut zov asked for bolk nski prince
andrew was in and bor s was shown into a large hall probably formerly
used for dancing but in which five beds now stood and furniture of
various kinds a table chairs and a clavichord one adjutant nearest
the door was sitting at the table in a persian dressing gown writing 
another the red stout nesv tski lay on a bed with his arms under his
head laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him a third was
playing a viennese waltz on the clavichord while a fourth lying on
the clavichord sang the tune bolk nski was not there none of these
gentlemen changed his position on seeing bor s the one who was writing
and whom bor s addressed turned round crossly and told him bolk nski
was on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into the
reception room if he wished to see him bor s thanked him and went to
the reception room where he found some ten officers and generals 

when he entered prince andrew his eyes drooping contemptuously with
that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says if
it were not my duty i would not talk to you for a moment was
listening to an old russian general with decorations who stood very
erect almost on tiptoe with a soldier s obsequious expression on his
purple face reporting something 

 very well then be so good as to wait said prince andrew to the
general in russian speaking with the french intonation he affected
when he wished to speak contemptuously and noticing bor s prince
andrew paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring
him to hear something more nodded and turned to him with a cheerful
smile 

at that moment bor s clearly realized what he had before surmised that
in the army besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the
military code which he and the others knew in the regiment there was
another more important subordination which made this tight laced 
purple faced general wait respectfully while captain prince andrew for
his own pleasure chose to chat with lieutenant drubetsk y more than
ever was bor s resolved to serve in future not according to the written
code but under this unwritten law he felt now that merely by having
been recommended to prince andrew he had already risen above the general
who at the front had the power to annihilate him a lieutenant of the
guards prince andrew came up to him and took his hand 

 i am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday i was fussing about
with germans all day we went with weyrother to survey the dispositions 
when germans start being accurate there s no end to it 

bor s smiled as if he understood what prince andrew was alluding to
as something generally known but it was the first time he had heard
weyrother s name or even the term dispositions 

 well my dear fellow so you still want to be an adjutant i have
been thinking about you 

 yes i was thinking for some reason bor s could not help
blushing of asking the commander in chief he has had a letter from
prince kur gin about me i only wanted to ask because i fear the guards
won t be in action he added as if in apology 

 all right all right we ll talk it over replied prince andrew 
 only let me report this gentleman s business and i shall be at
your disposal 

while prince andrew went to report about the purple faced general that
gentleman evidently not sharing bor s conception of the advantages
of the unwritten code of subordination looked so fixedly at the
presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to
say to the adjutant that bor s felt uncomfortable he turned away and
waited impatiently for prince andrew s return from the commander in
chief s room 

 you see my dear fellow i have been thinking about you 
said prince andrew when they had gone into the large room where the
clavichord was it s no use your going to the commander in chief 
he would say a lot of pleasant things ask you to dinner that
would not be bad as regards the unwritten code thought bor s 
 but nothing more would come of it there will soon be a battalion of
us aides de camp and adjutants but this is what we ll do i have
a good friend an adjutant general and an excellent fellow prince
dolgor kov and though you may not know it the fact is that now
kut zov with his staff and all of us count for nothing everything is
now centered round the emperor so we will go to dolgor kov i have to
go there anyhow and i have already spoken to him about you we shall
see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for you
somewhere nearer the sun 

prince andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young
man and help him to worldly success under cover of obtaining help
of this kind for another which from pride he would never accept for
himself he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and
which attracted him he very readily took up bor s cause and went
with him to dolgor kov 

it was late in the evening when they entered the palace at olm tz
occupied by the emperors and their retinues 

that same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of
the hofkriegsrath and both emperors took part at that council contrary
to the views of the old generals kut zov and prince schwartzenberg it
had been decided to advance immediately and give battle to bonaparte 
the council of war was just over when prince andrew accompanied
by bor s arrived at the palace to find dolgor kov everyone at
headquarters was still under the spell of the day s council at which
the party of the young had triumphed the voices of those who counseled
delay and advised waiting for something else before advancing had been
so completely silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive
evidence of the advantages of attacking that what had been discussed
at the council the coming battle and the victory that would certainly
result from it no longer seemed to be in the future but in the past 
all the advantages were on our side our enormous forces undoubtedly
superior to napoleon s were concentrated in one place the troops
inspired by the emperors presence were eager for action the
strategic position where the operations would take place was familiar in
all its details to the austrian general weyrother a lucky accident had
ordained that the austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the
very fields where the french had now to be fought the adjacent
locality was known and shown in every detail on the maps and bonaparte 
evidently weakened was undertaking nothing 

dolgor kov one of the warmest advocates of an attack had just
returned from the council tired and exhausted but eager and proud
of the victory that had been gained prince andrew introduced his
prot g but prince dolgor kov politely and firmly pressing his hand
said nothing to bor s and evidently unable to suppress the thoughts
which were uppermost in his mind at that moment addressed prince andrew
in french 

 ah my dear fellow what a battle we have gained god grant that
the one that will result from it will be as victorious however dear
fellow he said abruptly and eagerly i must confess to having
been unjust to the austrians and especially to weyrother what
exactitude what minuteness what knowledge of the locality what
foresight for every eventuality every possibility even to the smallest
detail no my dear fellow no conditions better than our present ones
could have been devised this combination of austrian precision with
russian valor what more could be wished for 

 so the attack is definitely resolved on asked bolk nski 

 and do you know my dear fellow it seems to me that bonaparte has
decidedly lost bearings you know that a letter was received from him
today for the emperor dolgor kov smiled significantly 

 is that so and what did he say inquired bolk nski 

 what can he say tra di ri di ra and so on merely to gain time 
i tell you he is in our hands that s certain but what was most
amusing he continued with a sudden good natured laugh was that
we could not think how to address the reply if not as consul 
and of course not as emperor it seemed to me it should be to
 general bonaparte 

 but between not recognizing him as emperor and calling him general
bonaparte there is a difference remarked bolk nski 

 that s just it interrupted dolgor kov quickly laughing 
 you know bil bin he s a very clever fellow he suggested
addressing him as usurper and enemy of mankind 

dolgor kov laughed merrily 

 only that said bolk nski 

 all the same it was bil bin who found a suitable form for the
address he is a wise and clever fellow 

 what was it 

 to the head of the french government au chef du gouvernement
fran ais said dolgor kov with grave satisfaction good 
wasn t it 

 yes but he will dislike it extremely said bolk nski 

 oh yes very much my brother knows him he s dined with him the
present emperor more than once in paris and tells me he never met a
more cunning or subtle diplomatist you know a combination of french
adroitness and italian play acting do you know the tale about him and
count mark v count mark v was the only man who knew how to handle
him you know the story of the handkerchief it is delightful 

and the talkative dolgor kov turning now to bor s now to prince
andrew told how bonaparte wishing to test mark v our ambassador 
purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking
at mark v probably expecting mark v to pick it up for him and how
mark v immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without
touching bonaparte s 

 delightful said bolk nski but i have come to you prince 
as a petitioner on behalf of this young man you see but
before prince andrew could finish an aide de camp came in to summon
dolgor kov to the emperor 

 oh what a nuisance said dolgor kov getting up hurriedly and
pressing the hands of prince andrew and bor s you know i should
be very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young
man again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of
good natured sincere and animated levity but you see another
time 

bor s was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers
as he felt himself to be at that moment he was conscious that here
he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous
movements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny 
obedient and insignificant atom they followed prince dolgor kov out
into the corridor and met coming out of the door of the emperor s
room by which dolgor kov had entered a short man in civilian clothes
with a clever face and sharply projecting jaw which without spoiling
his face gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression 
this short man nodded to dolgor kov as to an intimate friend and stared
at prince andrew with cool intensity walking straight toward him and
evidently expecting him to bow or to step out of his way prince andrew
did neither a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other
turned away and went down the side of the corridor 

 who was that asked bor s 

 he is one of the most remarkable but to me most unpleasant of
men the minister of foreign affairs prince adam czartor ski it
is such men as he who decide the fate of nations added bolk nski
with a sigh he could not suppress as they passed out of the palace 

next day the army began its campaign and up to the very battle of
austerlitz bor s was unable to see either prince andrew or dolgor kov
again and remained for a while with the ism ylov regiment 





chapter x

at dawn on the sixteenth of november den sov s squadron in
which nicholas rost v served and which was in prince bagrati n s
detachment moved from the place where it had spent the night advancing
into action as arranged and after going behind other columns for
about two thirds of a mile was stopped on the highroad rost v saw the
cossacks and then the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry
battalions and artillery pass by and go forward and then generals
bagrati n and dolgor kov ride past with their adjutants all the fear
before action which he had experienced as previously all the inner
struggle to conquer that fear all his dreams of distinguishing himself
as a true hussar in this battle had been wasted their squadron
remained in reserve and nicholas rost v spent that day in a dull and
wretched mood at nine in the morning he heard firing in front and
shouts of hurrah and saw wounded being brought back there were not
many of them and at last he saw how a whole detachment of french
cavalry was brought in convoyed by a s tnya of cossacks evidently the
affair was over and though not big had been a successful engagement 
the men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant victory of the
occupation of the town of wischau and the capture of a whole french
squadron the day was bright and sunny after a sharp night frost and
the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of
victory which was conveyed not only by the tales of those who had taken
part in it but also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers 
officers generals and adjutants as they passed rost v going or
coming and nicholas who had vainly suffered all the dread that
precedes a battle and had spent that happy day in inactivity was all
the more depressed 

 come here wost v let s dwink to dwown our gwief shouted
den sov who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some
food 

the officers gathered round den sov s canteen eating and talking 

 there they are bringing another cried one of the officers 
indicating a captive french dragoon who was being brought in on foot by
two cossacks 

one of them was leading by the bridle a fine large french horse he had
taken from the prisoner 

 sell us that horse den sov called out to the cossacks 

 if you like your honor 

the officers got up and stood round the cossacks and their prisoner 
the french dragoon was a young alsatian who spoke french with a german
accent he was breathless with agitation his face was red and when
he heard some french spoken he at once began speaking to the officers 
addressing first one then another he said he would not have been
taken it was not his fault but the corporal s who had sent him to
seize some horsecloths though he had told him the russians were there 
and at every word he added but don t hurt my little horse and
stroked the animal it was plain that he did not quite grasp where he
was now he excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now 
imagining himself before his own officers insisted on his soldierly
discipline and zeal in the service he brought with him into our
rearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the french army which was
so alien to us 

the cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces and rost v being the
richest of the officers now that he had received his money bought it 

 but don t hurt my little horse said the alsatian good naturedly
to rost v when the animal was handed over to the hussar 

rost v smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money 

 alley alley said the cossack touching the prisoner s arm to
make him go on 

 the emperor the emperor was suddenly heard among the hussars 

all began to run and bustle and rost v saw coming up the road behind
him several riders with white plumes in their hats in a moment everyone
was in his place waiting 

rost v did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted 
instantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected mood
amid people of whom he was weary had gone instantly every thought of
himself had vanished he was filled with happiness at his nearness to
the emperor he felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the
day he had lost he was happy as a lover when the longed for moment of
meeting arrives not daring to look round and without looking round he
was ecstatically conscious of his approach he felt it not only from the
sound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade but because as he drew
near everything grew brighter more joyful more significant and more
festive around him nearer and nearer to rost v came that sun shedding
beams of mild and majestic light around and already he felt himself
enveloped in those beams he heard his voice that kindly calm 
and majestic voice that was yet so simple and as if in accord with
rost v s feeling there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard
the emperor s voice 

 the p vlograd hussars he inquired 

 the reserves sire replied a voice a very human one compared to
that which had said the p vlograd hussars 

the emperor drew level with rost v and halted alexander s face was
even more beautiful than it had been three days before at the review it
shone with such gaiety and youth such innocent youth that it suggested
the liveliness of a fourteen year old boy and yet it was the face
of the majestic emperor casually while surveying the squadron the
emperor s eyes met rost v s and rested on them for not more than
two seconds whether or no the emperor understood what was going on in
rost v s soul it seemed to rost v that he understood everything 
at any rate his light blue eyes gazed for about two seconds into
rost v s face a gentle mild light poured from them then all at
once he raised his eyebrows abruptly touched his horse with his left
foot and galloped on 

the younger emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the
battle and in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers at twelve
o clock left the third column with which he had been and galloped
toward the vanguard before he came up with the hussars several
adjutants met him with news of the successful result of the action 

this battle which consisted in the capture of a french squadron was
represented as a brilliant victory over the french and so the
emperor and the whole army especially while the smoke hung over
the battlefield believed that the french had been defeated and were
retreating against their will a few minutes after the emperor had
passed the p vlograd division was ordered to advance in wischau
itself a petty german town rost v saw the emperor again in the
market place where there had been some rather heavy firing before the
emperor s arrival lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there
had not been time to move the emperor surrounded by his suite
of officers and courtiers was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare a
different one from that which he had ridden at the review and bending
to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked
at a soldier who lay prone with blood on his uncovered head the
wounded soldier was so dirty coarse and revolting that his proximity
to the emperor shocked rost v rost v saw how the emperor s rather
round shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them how his
left foot began convulsively tapping the horse s side with the spur 
and how the well trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not
stir an adjutant dismounting lifted the soldier under the arms to
place him on a stretcher that had been brought the soldier groaned 

 gently gently can t you do it more gently said the emperor
apparently suffering more than the dying soldier and he rode away 

rost v saw tears filling the emperor s eyes and heard him as he was
riding away say to czartor ski what a terrible thing war is what
a terrible thing quelle terrible chose que la guerre 

the troops of the vanguard were stationed before wischau within sight
of the enemy s lines which all day long had yielded ground to us
at the least firing the emperor s gratitude was announced to the
vanguard rewards were promised and the men received a double ration of
vodka the campfires crackled and the soldiers songs resounded
even more merrily than on the previous night den sov celebrated his
promotion to the rank of major and rost v who had already drunk
enough at the end of the feast proposed the emperor s health not
 our sovereign the emperor as they say at official dinners 
said he but the health of our sovereign that good enchanting and
great man let us drink to his health and to the certain defeat of the
french 

 if we fought before he said not letting the french pass as
at sch n grabern what shall we not do now when he is at the front we
will all die for him gladly is it not so gentlemen perhaps i am not
saying it right i have drunk a good deal but that is how i feel and
so do you too to the health of alexander the first hurrah 

 hurrah rang the enthusiastic voices of the officers 

and the old cavalry captain k rsten shouted enthusiastically and no
less sincerely than the twenty year old rost v 

when the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses k rsten filled
others and in shirt sleeves and breeches went glass in hand to the
soldiers bonfires and with his long gray mustache his white chest
showing under his open shirt he stood in a majestic pose in the light
of the campfire waving his uplifted arm 

 lads here s to our sovereign the emperor and victory over
our enemies hurrah he exclaimed in his dashing old hussar s
baritone 

the hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts 

late that night when all had separated den sov with his short hand
patted his favorite rost v on the shoulder 

 as there s no one to fall in love with on campaign he s fallen
in love with the tsar he said 

 den sov don t make fun of it cried rost v it is such a
lofty beautiful feeling such a 

 i believe it i believe it fwiend and i share and appwove 

 no you don t understand 

and rost v got up and went wandering among the campfires dreaming of
what happiness it would be to die not in saving the emperor s life
 he did not even dare to dream of that but simply to die before his
eyes he really was in love with the tsar and the glory of the russian
arms and the hope of future triumph and he was not the only man to
experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle
of austerlitz nine tenths of the men in the russian army were then in
love though less ecstatically with their tsar and the glory of the
russian arms 





chapter xi

the next day the emperor stopped at wischau and villier his physician 
was repeatedly summoned to see him at headquarters and among the troops
near by the news spread that the emperor was unwell he ate nothing and
had slept badly that night those around him reported the cause of this
indisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind by
the sight of the killed and wounded 

at daybreak on the seventeenth a french officer who had come with
a flag of truce demanding an audience with the russian emperor was
brought into wischau from our outposts this officer was savary the
emperor had only just fallen asleep and so savary had to wait at midday
he was admitted to the emperor and an hour later he rode off with
prince dolgor kov to the advanced post of the french army 

it was rumored that savary had been sent to propose to alexander
a meeting with napoleon to the joy and pride of the whole army a
personal interview was refused and instead of the sovereign prince
dolgor kov the victor at wischau was sent with savary to negotiate
with napoleon if contrary to expectations these negotiations were
actuated by a real desire for peace 

toward evening dolgor kov came back went straight to the tsar and
remained alone with him for a long time 

on the eighteenth and nineteenth of november the army advanced two
days march and the enemy s outposts after a brief interchange
of shots retreated in the highest army circles from midday on the
nineteenth a great excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till
the morning of the twentieth when the memorable battle of austerlitz
was fought 

till midday on the nineteenth the activity the eager talk running to
and fro and dispatching of adjutants was confined to the emperor s
headquarters but on the afternoon of that day this activity reached
kut zov s headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns 
by evening the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the
army and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth the whole
eighty thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of
voices and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles
long 

the concentrated activity which had begun at the emperor s
headquarters in the morning and had started the whole movement that
followed was like the first movement of the main wheel of a large tower
clock one wheel slowly moved another was set in motion and a third 
and wheels began to revolve faster and faster levers and cogwheels to
work chimes to play figures to pop out and the hands to advance with
regular motion as a result of all that activity 

just as in the mechanism of a clock so in the mechanism of the military
machine an impulse once given leads to the final result and just as
indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted
to them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet
reached wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and
the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement but a
neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared
to remain so for a hundred years but the moment comes when the lever
catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins
in the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken 

just as in a clock the result of the complicated motion of innumerable
wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the
hands which show the time so the result of all the complicated human
activities of 160 000 russians and french all their passions desires 
remorse humiliations sufferings outbursts of pride fear and
enthusiasm was only the loss of the battle of austerlitz the
so called battle of the three emperors that is to say a slow movement
of the hand on the dial of human history 

prince andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the
commander in chief 

at six in the evening kut zov went to the emperor s headquarters
and after staying but a short time with the tsar went to see the grand
marshal of the court count tolst y 

bolk nski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the
coming action from dolgor kov he felt that kut zov was upset
and dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were
dissatisfied with him and also that at the emperor s headquarters
everyone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something others do
not know he therefore wished to speak to dolgor kov 

 well how d you do my dear fellow said dolgor kov who was
sitting at tea with bil bin the fete is for tomorrow how is your
old fellow out of sorts 

 i won t say he is out of sorts but i fancy he would like to be
heard 

 but they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when he
talks sense but to temporize and wait for something now when bonaparte
fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible 

 yes you have seen him said prince andrew well what is
bonaparte like how did he impress you 

 yes i saw him and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as
a general engagement repeated dolgor kov evidently prizing this
general conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with
napoleon if he weren t afraid of a battle why did he ask for that
interview why negotiate and above all why retreat when to retreat is
so contrary to his method of conducting war believe me he is afraid 
afraid of a general battle his hour has come mark my words 

 but tell me what is he like eh said prince andrew again 

 he is a man in a gray overcoat very anxious that i should call
him your majesty but who to his chagrin got no title from
me that s the sort of man he is and nothing more replied
dolgor kov looking round at bil bin with a smile 

 despite my great respect for old kut zov he continued we
should be a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him
a chance to escape or to trick us now that we certainly have him in
our hands no we mustn t forget suv rov and his rule not to put
yourself in a position to be attacked but yourself to attack believe
me in war the energy of young men often shows the way better than all
the experience of old cunctators 

 but in what position are we going to attack him i have been at the
outposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces are
situated said prince andrew 

he wished to explain to dolgor kov a plan of attack he had himself
formed 

 oh that is all the same dolgor kov said quickly and getting up
he spread a map on the table all eventualities have been foreseen 
if he is standing before br nn 

and prince dolgor kov rapidly but indistinctly explained weyrother s
plan of a flanking movement 

prince andrew began to reply and to state his own plan which might
have been as good as weyrother s but for the disadvantage that
weyrother s had already been approved as soon as prince andrew began
to demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan 
prince dolgor kov ceased to listen to him and gazed absent mindedly not
at the map but at prince andrew s face 

 there will be a council of war at kut zov s tonight though you
can say all this there remarked dolgor kov 

 i will do so said prince andrew moving away from the map 

 whatever are you bothering about gentlemen said bil bin who 
till then had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and
now was evidently ready with a joke whether tomorrow brings
victory or defeat the glory of our russian arms is secure except your
kut zov there is not a single russian in command of a column the
commanders are herr general wimpfen le comte de langeron le prince de
lichtenstein le prince de hohenlohe and finally prishprish and so on
like all those polish names 

 be quiet backbiter said dolgor kov it is not true there
are now two russians milor dovich and dokht rov and there would be
a third count arakch ev if his nerves were not too weak 

 however i think general kut zov has come out said prince
andrew i wish you good luck and success gentlemen he added and
went out after shaking hands with dolgor kov and bil bin 

on the way home prince andrew could not refrain from asking kut zov 
who was sitting silently beside him what he thought of tomorrow s
battle 

kut zov looked sternly at his adjutant and after a pause replied 
 i think the battle will be lost and so i told count tolst y and
asked him to tell the emperor what do you think he replied but my
dear general i am engaged with rice and cutlets look after military
matters yourself yes that was the answer i got 





chapter xii

shortly after nine o clock that evening weyrother drove with his
plans to kut zov s quarters where the council of war was to be
held all the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in
chief s and with the exception of prince bagrati n who declined to
come were all there at the appointed time 

weyrother who was in full control of the proposed battle by his
eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied
and drowsy kut zov who reluctantly played the part of chairman and
president of the council of war weyrother evidently felt himself to be
at the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable he was
like a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart whether he was
pulling it or being pushed by it he did not know but rushed along at
headlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might lead
to weyrother had been twice that evening to the enemy s picket
line to reconnoiter personally and twice to the emperors russian and
austrian to report and explain and to his headquarters where he had
dictated the dispositions in german and now much exhausted he arrived
at kut zov s 

he was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the
commander in chief he interrupted him talked rapidly and indistinctly 
without looking at the man he was addressing and did not reply to
questions put to him he was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful 
weary and distracted air though at the same time he was haughty and
self confident 

kut zov was occupying a nobleman s castle of modest dimensions near
ostralitz in the large drawing room which had become the commander
in chief s office were gathered kut zov himself weyrother and the
members of the council of war they were drinking tea and only awaited
prince bagrati n to begin the council at last bagrati n s orderly
came with the news that the prince could not attend prince andrew came
in to inform the commander in chief of this and availing himself
of permission previously given him by kut zov to be present at the
council he remained in the room 

 since prince bagrati n is not coming we may begin said
weyrother hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on
which an enormous map of the environs of br nn was spread out 

kut zov with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over
his collar as if escaping was sitting almost asleep in a low chair 
with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms at the sound
of weyrother s voice he opened his one eye with an effort 

 yes yes if you please it is already late said he and nodding
his head he let it droop and again closed his eye 

if at first the members of the council thought that kut zov was
pretending to sleep the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that
followed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed
by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for
the dispositions or anything else he was engaged in satisfying the
irresistible human need for sleep he really was asleep weyrother with
the gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment glanced at kut zov and 
having convinced himself that he was asleep took up a paper and in
a loud monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the
impending battle under a heading which he also read out 

 dispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind kobelnitz and
sokolnitz november 30 1805 

the dispositions were very complicated and difficult they began as
follows 

 as the enemy s left wing rests on wooded hills and his right
extends along kobelnitz and sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there 
while we on the other hand with our left wing by far outflank his
right it is advantageous to attack the enemy s latter wing especially
if we occupy the villages of sokolnitz and kobelnitz whereby we
can both fall on his flank and pursue him over the plain between
schlappanitz and the thuerassa forest avoiding the defiles of
schlappanitz and bellowitz which cover the enemy s front for this
object it is necessary that the first column marches the second
column marches the third column marches and so on read
weyrother 

the generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions 
the tall fair haired general buxh wden stood leaning his back against
the wall his eyes fixed on a burning candle and seemed not to listen
or even to wish to be thought to listen exactly opposite weyrother 
with his glistening wide open eyes fixed upon him and his mustache
twisted upwards sat the ruddy milor dovich in a military pose his
elbows turned outwards his hands on his knees and his shoulders
raised he remained stubbornly silent gazing at weyrother s face 
and only turned away his eyes when the austrian chief of staff finished
reading then milor dovich looked round significantly at the other
generals but one could not tell from that significant look whether he
agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements next
to weyrother sat count langeron who with a subtle smile that never left
his typically southern french face during the whole time of the reading 
gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners
a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait in the middle of one of the
longest sentences he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox raised
his head and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his
thin lips interrupted weyrother wishing to say something but the
austrian general continuing to read frowned angrily and jerked his
elbows as if to say you can tell me your views later but now be so
good as to look at the map and listen langeron lifted his eyes with
an expression of perplexity turned round to milor dovich as if seeking
an explanation but meeting the latter s impressive but meaningless
gaze drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox 

 a geography lesson he muttered as if to himself but loud enough
to be heard 

przebysz wski with respectful but dignified politeness held his
hand to his ear toward weyrother with the air of a man absorbed in
attention dohkt rov a little man sat opposite weyrother with
an assiduous and modest mien and stooping over the outspread map
conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality he
asked weyrother several times to repeat words he had not clearly heard
and the difficult names of villages weyrother complied and dohkt rov
noted them down 

when the reading which lasted more than an hour was over langeron again
brought his snuffbox to rest and without looking at weyrother or at
anyone in particular began to say how difficult it was to carry out
such a plan in which the enemy s position was assumed to be known 
whereas it was perhaps not known since the enemy was in movement 
langeron s objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief
aim was to show general weyrother who had read his dispositions with
as much self confidence as if he were addressing school children that
he had to do not with fools but with men who could teach him something
in military matters 

when the monotonous sound of weyrother s voice ceased kut zov opened
his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheel
is interrupted he listened to what langeron said as if remarking 
 so you are still at that silly business quickly closed his eye
again and let his head sink still lower 

langeron trying as virulently as possible to sting weyrother s vanity
as author of the military plan argued that bonaparte might easily
attack instead of being attacked and so render the whole of this
plan perfectly worthless weyrother met all objections with a firm and
contemptuous smile evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections
be they what they might 

 if he could attack us he would have done so today said he 

 so you think he is powerless said langeron 

 he has forty thousand men at most replied weyrother with the
smile of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of
a case 

 in that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack said
langeron with a subtly ironical smile again glancing round for support
to milor dovich who was near him 

but milor dovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything
rather than of what the generals were disputing about 

 ma foi said he tomorrow we shall see all that on the
battlefield 

weyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it was
strange and ridiculous to meet objections from russian generals and to
have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of but
had also convinced the sovereign emperors of 

 the enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from
his camp said he what does that mean either he is retreating 
which is the only thing we need fear or he is changing his position 
 he smiled ironically but even if he also took up a position in
the thuerassa he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all our
arrangements to the minutest detail remain the same 

 how is that began prince andrew who had for long been waiting
an opportunity to express his doubts 

kut zov here woke up coughed heavily and looked round at the
generals 

 gentlemen the dispositions for tomorrow or rather for today for
it is past midnight cannot now be altered said he you have
heard them and we shall all do our duty but before a battle there is
nothing more important he paused than to have a good sleep 

he moved as if to rise the generals bowed and retired it was past
midnight prince andrew went out 

the council of war at which prince andrew had not been able to
express his opinion as he had hoped to left on him a vague and uneasy
impression whether dolgor kov and weyrother or kut zov langeron 
and the others who did not approve of the plan of attack were
right he did not know but was it really not possible for kut zov
to state his views plainly to the emperor is it possible that on
account of court and personal considerations tens of thousands of lives 
and my life my life he thought must be risked 

 yes it is very likely that i shall be killed tomorrow he
thought and suddenly at this thought of death a whole series of most
distant most intimate memories rose in his imagination he remembered
his last parting from his father and his wife he remembered the days
when he first loved her he thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for
her and for himself and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he
went out of the hut in which he was billeted with nesv tski and began
to walk up and down before it 

the night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed
mysteriously yes tomorrow tomorrow he thought tomorrow
everything may be over for me all these memories will be no more none
of them will have any meaning for me tomorrow perhaps even certainly 
i have a presentiment that for the first time i shall have to show all
i can do and his fancy pictured the battle its loss the
concentration of fighting at one point and the hesitation of all the
commanders and then that happy moment that toulon for which he had
so long waited presents itself to him at last he firmly and clearly
expresses his opinion to kut zov to weyrother and to the emperors 
all are struck by the justness of his views but no one undertakes to
carry them out so he takes a regiment a division stipulates that no
one is to interfere with his arrangements leads his division to
the decisive point and gains the victory alone but death and
suffering suggested another voice prince andrew however did not
answer that voice and went on dreaming of his triumphs the dispositions
for the next battle are planned by him alone nominally he is only an
adjutant on kut zov s staff but he does everything alone the next
battle is won by him alone kut zov is removed and he is appointed 
 well and then asked the other voice if before that you are
not ten times wounded killed or betrayed well what then 
 well then prince andrew answered himself i don t know
what will happen and don t want to know and can t but if i want
this want glory want to be known to men want to be loved by them it
is not my fault that i want it and want nothing but that and live only
for that yes for that alone i shall never tell anyone but oh god 
what am i to do if i love nothing but fame and men s esteem death 
wounds the loss of family i fear nothing and precious and dear
as many persons are to me father sister wife those dearest to
me yet dreadful and unnatural as it seems i would give them all at
once for a moment of glory of triumph over men of love from men i
don t know and never shall know for the love of these men here he
thought as he listened to voices in kut zov s courtyard the voices
were those of the orderlies who were packing up one voice probably a
coachman s was teasing kut zov s old cook whom prince andrew knew 
and who was called tit he was saying tit i say tit 

 well returned the old man 

 go tit thresh a bit said the wag 

 oh go to the devil called out a voice drowned by the laughter
of the orderlies and servants 

 all the same i love and value nothing but triumph over them all i
value this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in this
mist 





chapter xiii

that same night rost v was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front
of bagrati n s detachment his hussars were placed along the line
in couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master the
sleepiness that kept coming over him an enormous space with our
army s campfires dimly glowing in the fog could be seen behind him 
in front of him was misty darkness rost v could see nothing peer as
he would into that foggy distance now something gleamed gray now there
was something black now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy
ought to be now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes his
eyes kept closing and in his fancy appeared now the emperor now
den sov and now moscow memories and he again hurriedly opened his
eyes and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was
riding and sometimes when he came within six paces of them the
black figures of hussars but in the distance was still the same misty
darkness why not it might easily happen thought rost v 
 that the emperor will meet me and give me an order as he would to any
other officer he ll say go and find out what s there there
are many stories of his getting to know an officer in just such a chance
way and attaching him to himself what if he gave me a place near him 
oh how i would guard him how i would tell him the truth how i would
unmask his deceivers and in order to realize vividly his love
devotion to the sovereign rost v pictured to himself an enemy or a
deceitful german whom he would not only kill with pleasure but whom
he would slap in the face before the emperor suddenly a distant shout
aroused him he started and opened his eyes 

 where am i oh yes in the skirmishing line pass and
watchword shaft olm tz what a nuisance that our squadron will be in
reserve tomorrow he thought i ll ask leave to go to the front 
this may be my only chance of seeing the emperor it won t be long
now before i am off duty i ll take another turn and when i get back
i ll go to the general and ask him he readjusted himself in the
saddle and touched up his horse to ride once more round his hussars it
seemed to him that it was getting lighter to the left he saw a sloping
descent lit up and facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a
wall on this knoll there was a white patch that rost v could not at
all make out was it a glade in the wood lit up by the moon or some
unmelted snow or some white houses he even thought something moved on
that white spot i expect it s snow that spot a spot une
tache he thought there now it s not a tache nat sha 
sister black eyes na tasha won t she be surprised when
i tell her how i ve seen the emperor nat sha take my
sabretache keep to the right your honor there are bushes
here came the voice of an hussar past whom rost v was riding in
the act of falling asleep rost v lifted his head that had sunk almost
to his horse s mane and pulled up beside the hussar he was succumbing
to irresistible youthful childish drowsiness but what was i
thinking i mustn t forget how shall i speak to the emperor no 
that s not it that s tomorrow oh yes nat sha sabretache 
saber them whom the hussars ah the hussars with mustaches along
the tversk ya street rode the hussar with mustaches i thought about
him too just opposite g ryev s house old g ryev oh but
den sov s a fine fellow but that s all nonsense the chief thing
is that the emperor is here how he looked at me and wished to say
something but dared not no it was i who dared not but that s
nonsense the chief thing is not to forget the important thing i
was thinking of yes na t sha sabretache oh yes yes that s
right and his head once more sank to his horse s neck all at once
it seemed to him that he was being fired at what what what cut
them down what said rost v waking up at the moment he opened
his eyes he heard in front of him where the enemy was the long drawn
shouts of thousands of voices his horse and the horse of the hussar
near him pricked their ears at these shouts over there where the
shouting came from a fire flared up and went out again then another 
and all along the french line on the hill fires flared up and the
shouting grew louder and louder rost v could hear the sound of french
words but could not distinguish them the din of many voices was too
great all he could hear was ahahah and rrrr 

 what s that what do you make of it said rost v to the hussar
beside him that must be the enemy s camp 

the hussar did not reply 

 why don t you hear it rost v asked again after waiting for a
reply 

 who can tell your honor replied the hussar reluctantly 

 from the direction it must be the enemy repeated rost v 

 it may be he or it may be nothing muttered the hussar it s
dark steady he cried to his fidgeting horse 

rost v s horse was also getting restive it pawed the frozen ground 
pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights the shouting
grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army
of several thousand men could produce the lights spread farther and
farther probably along the line of the french camp rost v no longer
wanted to sleep the gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a
stimulating effect on him vive l empereur l empereur he now
heard distinctly 

 they can t be far off probably just beyond the stream he said
to the hussar beside him 

the hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily the sound
of horse s hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was
heard and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars
suddenly appeared looming huge as an elephant 

 your honor the generals said the sergeant riding up to rost v 

rost v still looking round toward the fires and the shouts rode with
the sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the line 
one was on a white horse prince bagrati n and prince dolgor kov with
their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the
lights and shouts in the enemy s camp rost v rode up to bagrati n 
reported to him and then joined the adjutants listening to what the
generals were saying 

 believe me said prince dolgor kov addressing bagrati n it
is nothing but a trick he has retreated and ordered the rearguard to
kindle fires and make a noise to deceive us 

 hardly said bagrati n i saw them this evening on that
knoll if they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too 
officer said bagrati n to rost v are the enemy s skirmishers
still there 

 they were there this evening but now i don t know your
excellency shall i go with some of my hussars to see replied
rost v 

bagrati n stopped and before replying tried to see rost v s face
in the mist 

 well go and see he said after a pause 

 yes sir 

rost v spurred his horse called to sergeant f dchenko and two other
hussars told them to follow him and trotted downhill in the direction
from which the shouting came he felt both frightened and pleased to be
riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty
distance where no one had been before him bagrati n called to him from
the hill not to go beyond the stream but rost v pretended not to hear
him and did not stop but rode on and on continually mistaking bushes
for trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakes 
having descended the hill at a trot he no longer saw either our own or
the enemy s fires but heard the shouting of the french more loudly
and distinctly in the valley he saw before him something like a river 
but when he reached it he found it was a road having come out onto
the road he reined in his horse hesitating whether to ride along it or
cross it and ride over the black field up the hillside to keep to the
road which gleamed white in the mist would have been safer because it
would be easier to see people coming along it follow me said he 
crossed the road and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the
point where the french pickets had been standing that evening 

 your honor there he is cried one of the hussars behind him and
before rost v had time to make out what the black thing was that had
suddenly appeared in the fog there was a flash followed by a report 
and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passed
out of hearing another musket missed fire but flashed in the pan 
rost v turned his horse and galloped back four more reports followed
at intervals and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in
different tones rost v reined in his horse whose spirits had risen 
like his own at the firing and went back at a footpace well some
more some more a merry voice was saying in his soul but no more
shots came 

only when approaching bagrati n did rost v let his horse gallop again 
and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general 

dolgor kov was still insisting that the french had retreated and had
only lit fires to deceive us 

 what does that prove he was saying as rost v rode up they
might retreat and leave the pickets 

 it s plain that they have not all gone yet prince said
bagrati n wait till tomorrow morning we ll find out everything
tomorrow 

 the picket is still on the hill your excellency just where it was
in the evening reported rost v stooping forward with his hand at
the salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his
ride and especially by the sound of the bullets 

 very good very good said bagrati n thank you officer 

 your excellency said rost v may i ask a favor 

 what is it 

 tomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve may i ask to be attached
to the first squadron 

 what s your name 

 count rost v 

 oh very well you may stay in attendance on me 

 count ily rost v s son asked dolgor kov 

but rost v did not reply 

 then i may reckon on it your excellency 

 i will give the order 

 tomorrow very likely i may be sent with some message to the
emperor thought rost v 

 thank god 

the fires and shouting in the enemy s army were occasioned by the fact
that while napoleon s proclamation was being read to the troops the
emperor himself rode round his bivouacs the soldiers on seeing him 
lit wisps of straw and ran after him shouting vive l empereur 
napoleon s proclamation was as follows 

soldiers the russian army is advancing against you to avenge the
austrian army of ulm they are the same battalions you broke at
hollabr nn and have pursued ever since to this place the position we
occupy is a strong one and while they are marching to go round me on
the right they will expose a flank to me soldiers i will myself direct
your battalions i will keep out of fire if you with your habitual
valor carry disorder and confusion into the enemy s ranks but should
victory be in doubt even for a moment you will see your emperor
exposing himself to the first blows of the enemy for there must be no
doubt of victory especially on this day when what is at stake is the
honor of the french infantry so necessary to the honor of our nation 

do not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded let every
man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelings
of england inspired by such hatred of our nation this victory will
conclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters where fresh
french troops who are being raised in france will join us and the peace
i shall conclude will be worthy of my people of you and of myself 

napoleon




chapter xiv

at five in the morning it was still quite dark the troops of the
center the reserves and bagrati n s right flank had not yet moved 
but on the left flank the columns of infantry cavalry and artillery 
which were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the french
right flank and drive it into the bohemian mountains according to plan 
were already up and astir the smoke of the campfires into which they
were throwing everything superfluous made the eyes smart it was cold
and dark the officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting the
soldiers munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to
warm themselves gathering round the fires throwing into the flames the
remains of sheds chairs tables wheels tubs and everything that they
did not want or could not carry away with them austrian column guides
were moving in and out among the russian troops and served as heralds
of the advance as soon as an austrian officer showed himself near
a commanding officer s quarters the regiment began to move the
soldiers ran from the fires thrust their pipes into their boots their
bags into the carts got their muskets ready and formed rank the
officers buttoned up their coats buckled on their swords and pouches 
and moved along the ranks shouting the train drivers and orderlies
harnessed and packed the wagons and tied on the loads the adjutants and
battalion and regimental commanders mounted crossed themselves gave
final instructions orders and commissions to the baggage men
who remained behind and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet
resounded the column moved forward without knowing where and unable 
from the masses around them the smoke and the increasing fog to see
either the place they were leaving or that to which they were going 

a soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as
much as a sailor is by his ship however far he has walked whatever
strange unknown and dangerous places he reaches just as a sailor is
always surrounded by the same decks masts and rigging of his ship so
the soldier always has around him the same comrades the same ranks the
same sergeant major iv n m trich the same company dog jack and the
same commanders the sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which
his ship is sailing but on the day of battle heaven knows how and
whence a stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral
atmosphere of an army announcing the approach of something decisive
and solemn and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity on the day of
battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their
regiment they listen intently look about and eagerly ask concerning
what is going on around them 

the fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could
not see ten paces ahead bushes looked like gigantic trees and level
ground like cliffs and slopes anywhere on any side one might
encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off but the columns advanced
for a long time always in the same fog descending and ascending hills 
avoiding gardens and enclosures going over new and unknown ground and
nowhere encountering the enemy on the contrary the soldiers became
aware that in front behind and on all sides other russian columns
were moving in the same direction every soldier felt glad to know that
to the unknown place where he was going many more of our men were going
too 

 there now the k rskies have also gone past was being said in
the ranks 

 it s wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered lads last
night i looked at the campfires and there was no end of them a regular
moscow 

though none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked to
the men the commanders as we saw at the council of war were out of
humor and dissatisfied with the affair and so did not exert themselves
to cheer the men but merely carried out the orders yet the troops
marched gaily as they always do when going into action especially to
an attack but when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog 
the greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness
of some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks how such
a consciousness is communicated is very difficult to define but it
certainly is communicated very surely and flows rapidly imperceptibly 
and irrepressibly as water does in a creek had the russian army been
alone without any allies it might perhaps have been a long time before
this consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction but as
it was the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupid
germans and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had been
occasioned by the sausage eaters 

 why have we stopped is the way blocked or have we already come up
against the french 

 no one can t hear them they d be firing if we had 

 they were in a hurry enough to start us and now here we stand in
the middle of a field without rhyme or reason it s all those damned
germans muddling what stupid devils 

 yes i d send them on in front but no fear they re crowding up
behind and now here we stand hungry 

 i say shall we soon be clear they say the cavalry are blocking the
way said an officer 

 ah those damned germans they don t know their own country 
said another 

 what division are you shouted an adjutant riding up 

 the eighteenth 

 then why are you here you should have gone on long ago now you
won t get there till evening 

 what stupid orders they don t themselves know what they are
doing said the officer and rode off 

then a general rode past shouting something angrily not in russian 

 tafa lafa but what he s jabbering no one can make out said a
soldier mimicking the general who had ridden away i d shoot them 
the scoundrels 

 we were ordered to be at the place before nine but we haven t got
halfway fine orders was being repeated on different sides 

and the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to
turn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the
germans 

the cause of the confusion was that while the austrian cavalry was
moving toward our left flank the higher command found that our center
was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all
ordered to turn back to the right several thousand cavalry crossed in
front of the infantry who had to wait 

at the front an altercation occurred between an austrian guide and a
russian general the general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be
halted the austrian argued that not he but the higher command was to
blame the troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited after
an hour s delay they at last moved on descending the hill the fog
that was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below where they
were descending in front in the fog a shot was heard and then another 
at first irregularly at varying intervals trata tat and then more
and more regularly and rapidly and the action at the goldbach stream
began 

not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream and having
stumbled on him in the fog hearing no encouraging word from their
commanders and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through
the ranks and above all being unable to see anything in front or around
them in the thick fog the russians exchanged shots with the enemy
lazily and advanced and again halted receiving no timely orders from
the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown
surroundings unable to find their own regiments in this way the action
began for the first second and third columns which had gone down into
the valley the fourth column with which kut zov was stood on the
pratzen heights 

below where the fight was beginning there was still thick fog on the
higher ground it was clearing but nothing could be seen of what was
going on in front whether all the enemy forces were as we supposed 
six miles away or whether they were near by in that sea of mist no one
knew till after eight o clock 

it was nine o clock in the morning the fog lay unbroken like a sea
down below but higher up at the village of schlappanitz where napoleon
stood with his marshals around him it was quite light above him was
a clear blue sky and the sun s vast orb quivered like a huge hollow 
crimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist the whole french
army and even napoleon himself with his staff were not on the far side
of the streams and hollows of sokolnitz and schlappanitz beyond which we
intended to take up our position and begin the action but were on this
side so close to our own forces that napoleon with the naked eye could
distinguish a mounted man from one on foot napoleon in the blue cloak
which he had worn on his italian campaign sat on his small gray arab
horse a little in front of his marshals he gazed silently at the hills
which seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the russian
troops were moving in the distance and he listened to the sounds of
firing in the valley not a single muscle of his face which in those
days was still thin moved his gleaming eyes were fixed intently on
one spot his predictions were being justified part of the russian
force had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes
and part were leaving these pratzen heights which he intended to attack
and regarded as the key to the position he saw over the mist that in
a hollow between two hills near the village of pratzen the russian
columns their bayonets glittering were moving continuously in one
direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into
the mist from information he had received the evening before from the
sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night 
by the disorderly movement of the russian columns and from all
indications he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far away
in front of them and that the columns moving near pratzen constituted
the center of the russian army and that that center was already
sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked but still he did not
begin the engagement 

today was a great day for him the anniversary of his coronation 
before dawn he had slept for a few hours and refreshed vigorous and
in good spirits he mounted his horse and rode out into the field
in that happy mood in which everything seems possible and everything
succeeds he sat motionless looking at the heights visible above
the mist and his cold face wore that special look of confident 
self complacent happiness that one sees on the face of a boy happily
in love the marshals stood behind him not venturing to distract his
attention he looked now at the pratzen heights now at the sun floating
up out of the mist 

when the sun had entirely emerged from the fog and fields and mist were
aglow with dazzling light as if he had only awaited this to begin the
action he drew the glove from his shapely white hand made a sign
with it to the marshals and ordered the action to begin the marshals 
accompanied by adjutants galloped off in different directions and
a few minutes later the chief forces of the french army moved rapidly
toward those pratzen heights which were being more and more denuded by
russian troops moving down the valley to their left 





chapter xv

at eight o clock kut zov rode to pratzen at the head of the fourth
column milor dovich s the one that was to take the place of
przebysz wski s and langeron s columns which had already gone down
into the valley he greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave
them the order to march thereby indicating that he intended to lead
that column himself when he had reached the village of pratzen he
halted prince andrew was behind among the immense number forming the
commander in chief s suite he was in a state of suppressed excitement
and irritation though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach of
a long awaited moment he was firmly convinced that this was the day of
his toulon or his bridge of arcola how it would come about he did not
know but he felt sure it would do so the locality and the position of
our troops were known to him as far as they could be known to anyone
in our army his own strategic plan which obviously could not now
be carried out was forgotten now entering into weyrother s plan 
prince andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects
such as might call for his rapidity of perception and decision 

to the left down below in the mist the musketry fire of unseen forces
could be heard it was there prince andrew thought the fight would
concentrate there we shall encounter difficulties and there 
thought he i shall be sent with a brigade or division and there 
standard in hand i shall go forward and break whatever is in front of
me 

he could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions 
seeing them he kept thinking that may be the very standard with
which i shall lead the army 

in the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was
a hoar frost now turning to dew but in the valleys it still lay like a
milk white sea nothing was visible in the valley to the left into which
our troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firing 
above the heights was the dark clear sky and to the right the vast orb
of the sun in front far off on the farther shore of that sea of mist 
some wooded hills were discernible and it was there the enemy probably
was for something could be descried on the right the guards were
entering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now and
then a gleam of bayonets to the left beyond the village similar masses
of cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea of mist in front and
behind moved infantry the commander in chief was standing at the end of
the village letting the troops pass by him that morning kut zov seemed
worn and irritable the infantry passing before him came to a halt
without any command being given apparently obstructed by something in
front 

 do order them to form into battalion columns and go round the
village he said angrily to a general who had ridden up don t
you understand your excellency my dear sir that you must not
defile through narrow village streets when we are marching against the
enemy 

 i intended to re form them beyond the village your excellency 
answered the general 

kut zov laughed bitterly 

 you ll make a fine thing of it deploying in sight of the enemy 
very fine 

 the enemy is still far away your excellency according to the
dispositions 

 the dispositions exclaimed kut zov bitterly who told you
that kindly do as you are ordered 

 yes sir 

 my dear fellow nesv tski whispered to prince andrew the old
man is as surly as a dog 

an austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hat
galloped up to kut zov and asked in the emperor s name had the fourth
column advanced into action 

kut zov turned round without answering and his eye happened to fall
upon prince andrew who was beside him seeing him kut zov s
malevolent and caustic expression softened as if admitting that what
was being done was not his adjutant s fault and still not answering
the austrian adjutant he addressed bolk nski 

 go my dear fellow and see whether the third division has passed the
village tell it to stop and await my orders 

hardly had prince andrew started than he stopped him 

 and ask whether sharpshooters have been posted he added what
are they doing what are they doing he murmured to himself still
not replying to the austrian 

prince andrew galloped off to execute the order 

overtaking the battalions that continued to advance he stopped
the third division and convinced himself that there really were no
sharpshooters in front of our columns the colonel at the head of the
regiment was much surprised at the commander in chief s order to throw
out skirmishers he had felt perfectly sure that there were other troops
in front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles away 
there was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descent
hidden by dense mist having given orders in the commander in chief s
name to rectify this omission prince andrew galloped back kut zov
still in the same place his stout body resting heavily in the saddle
with the lassitude of age sat yawning wearily with closed eyes the
troops were no longer moving but stood with the butts of their muskets
on the ground 

 all right all right he said to prince andrew and turned to a
general who watch in hand was saying it was time they started as all
the left flank columns had already descended 

 plenty of time your excellency muttered kut zov in the midst of
a yawn plenty of time he repeated 

just then at a distance behind kut zov was heard the sound of regiments
saluting and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extended
line of the advancing russian columns evidently the person they were
greeting was riding quickly when the soldiers of the regiment in front
of which kut zov was standing began to shout he rode a little to one
side and looked round with a frown along the road from pratzen galloped
what looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms two of them
rode side by side in front at full gallop one in a black uniform with
white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse the other who
was in a white uniform rode a black one these were the two emperors
followed by their suites kut zov affecting the manners of an old
soldier at the front gave the command attention and rode up
to the emperors with a salute his whole appearance and manner were
suddenly transformed he put on the air of a subordinate who obeys
without reasoning with an affectation of respect which evidently struck
alexander unpleasantly he rode up and saluted 

this unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy face
of the emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanished 
after his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field
of olm tz where bolk nski had seen him for the first time abroad but
there was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness
in his fine gray eyes and on his delicate lips the same capacity for
varying expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted
innocent youth 

at the olm tz review he had seemed more majestic here he seemed
brighter and more energetic he was slightly flushed after galloping two
miles and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round
at the faces of his suite young and animated as his own czartor ski 
novos ltsev prince volk nsky str gonov and the others all richly
dressed gay young men on splendid well groomed fresh only slightly
heated horses exchanging remarks and smiling had stopped behind the
emperor the emperor francis a rosy long faced young man sat very
erect on his handsome black horse looking about him in a leisurely and
preoccupied manner he beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked
some question most likely he is asking at what o clock they
started thought prince andrew watching his old acquaintance with
a smile he could not repress as he recalled his reception at br nn 
in the emperors suite were the picked young orderly officers of the
guard and line regiments russian and austrian among them were grooms
leading the tsar s beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered
cloths 

as when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters
a stuffy room so a whiff of youthfulness energy and confidence of
success reached kut zov s cheerless staff with the galloping advent
of all these brilliant young men 

 why aren t you beginning michael ilari novich said the
emperor alexander hurriedly to kut zov glancing courteously at the
same time at the emperor francis 

 i am waiting your majesty answered kut zov bending forward
respectfully 

the emperor frowning slightly bent his ear forward as if he had not
quite heard 

 waiting your majesty repeated kut zov prince andrew noted
that kut zov s upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the
word waiting not all the columns have formed up yet your
majesty 

the tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply he shrugged his
rather round shoulders and glanced at novos ltsev who was near him as
if complaining of kut zov 

 you know michael ilari novich we are not on the empress field
where a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled said
the tsar with another glance at the emperor francis as if inviting
him if not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying but the
emperor francis continued to look about him and did not listen 

 that is just why i do not begin sire said kut zov in a
resounding voice apparently to preclude the possibility of not being
heard and again something in his face twitched that is just why
i do not begin sire because we are not on parade and not on the
empress field said he clearly and distinctly 

in the emperor s suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed
dissatisfaction and reproach old though he may be he should not he
certainly should not speak like that their glances seemed to say 

the tsar looked intently and observantly into kut zov s eye
waiting to hear whether he would say anything more but kut zov with
respectfully bowed head seemed also to be waiting the silence lasted
for about a minute 

 however if you command it your majesty said kut zov lifting
his head and again assuming his former tone of a dull unreasoning but
submissive general 

he touched his horse and having called milor dovich the commander of
the column gave him the order to advance 

the troops again began to move and two battalions of the n vgorod and
one of the psheron regiment went forward past the emperor 

as this psheron battalion marched by the red faced milor dovich 
without his greatcoat with his orders on his breast and an enormous
tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners front
and back galloped strenuously forward and with a dashing salute reined
in his horse before the emperor 

 god be with you general said the emperor 

 ma foi sire nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilit 
sire he answered gaily raising nevertheless ironic smiles among
the gentlemen of the tsar s suite by his poor french 

 indeed sire we shall do everything it is possible to
 do sire 


milor dovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little
behind the emperor the psheron men excited by the tsar s presence 
passed in step before the emperors and their suites at a bold brisk
pace 

 lads shouted milor dovich in a loud self confident and cheery
voice obviously so elated by the sound of firing by the prospect of
battle and by the sight of the gallant psherons his comrades in
suv rov s time now passing so gallantly before the emperors that he
forgot the sovereigns presence lads it s not the first village
you ve had to take cried he 

 glad to do our best shouted the soldiers 

the emperor s horse started at the sudden cry this horse that had
carried the sovereign at reviews in russia bore him also here on the
field of austerlitz enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and
pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the
empress field not understanding the significance of the firing nor
of the nearness of the emperor francis black cob nor of all that was
being said thought and felt that day by its rider 

the emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a
remark to him pointing to the gallant psherons 





chapter xvi

kut zov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the
carabineers 

when he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he
stopped at a solitary deserted house that had probably once been an
inn where two roads parted both of them led downhill and troops were
marching along both 

the fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible
about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights down below on
the left the firing became more distinct kut zov had stopped and was
speaking to an austrian general prince andrew who was a little behind
looking at them turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass 

 look look said this adjutant looking not at the troops in the
distance but down the hill before him it s the french 

the two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass trying
to snatch it from one another the expression on all their faces
suddenly changed to one of horror the french were supposed to be a
mile and a half away but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in
front of us 

 it s the enemy no yes see it is for certain but
how is that said different voices 

with the naked eye prince andrew saw below them to the right not more
than five hundred paces from where kut zov was standing a dense french
column coming up to meet the psherons 

 here it is the decisive moment has arrived my turn has come 
thought prince andrew and striking his horse he rode up to kut zov 

 the psherons must be stopped your excellency cried he but at
that very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round firing was heard
quite close at hand and a voice of na ve terror barely two steps from
prince andrew shouted brothers all s lost and at this as if
at a command everyone began to run 

confused and ever increasing crowds were running back to where five
minutes before the troops had passed the emperors not only would it
have been difficult to stop that crowd it was even impossible not to
be carried back with it oneself bolk nski only tried not to lose
touch with it and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what was
happening in front of him nesv tski with an angry face red and unlike
himself was shouting to kut zov that if he did not ride away at once
he would certainly be taken prisoner kut zov remained in the same
place and without answering drew out a handkerchief blood was flowing
from his cheek prince andrew forced his way to him 

 you are wounded he asked hardly able to master the trembling of
his lower jaw 

 the wound is not here it is there said kut zov pressing the
handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers 
 stop them he shouted and at the same moment probably realizing
that it was impossible to stop them spurred his horse and rode to the
right 

a fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it 

the troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by
them it was difficult to get out again one was shouting get on 
why are you hindering us another in the same place turned round and
fired in the air a third was striking the horse kut zov himself rode 
having by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men 
kut zov with his suite diminished by more than half rode toward a
sound of artillery fire near by having forced his way out of the crowd
of fugitives prince andrew trying to keep near kut zov saw on the
slope of the hill amid the smoke a russian battery that was still firing
and frenchmen running toward it higher up stood some russian infantry 
neither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the
fleeing crowd a mounted general separated himself from the infantry and
approached kut zov of kut zov s suite only four remained they were
all pale and exchanged looks in silence 

 stop those wretches gasped kut zov to the regimental commander 
pointing to the flying soldiers but at that instant as if to punish
him for those words bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across
kut zov s suite like a flock of little birds 

the french had attacked the battery and seeing kut zov were firing
at him after this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg 
several soldiers fell and a second lieutenant who was holding the
flag let it fall from his hands it swayed and fell but caught on the
muskets of the nearest soldiers the soldiers started firing without
orders 

 oh oh oh groaned kut zov despairingly and looked around 
 bolk nski he whispered his voice trembling from a consciousness
of the feebleness of age bolk nski he whispered pointing to
the disordered battalion and at the enemy what s that 

but before he had finished speaking prince andrew feeling tears of
shame and anger choking him had already leapt from his horse and run to
the standard 

 forward lads he shouted in a voice piercing as a child s 

 here it is thought he seizing the staff of the standard and
hearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him 
several soldiers fell 

 hurrah shouted prince andrew and scarcely able to hold up
the heavy standard he ran forward with full confidence that the whole
battalion would follow him 

and really he only ran a few steps alone one soldier moved and then
another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting hurrah 
and overtook him a sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag
that was swaying from its weight in prince andrew s hands but he
was immediately killed prince andrew again seized the standard and 
dragging it by the staff ran on with the battalion in front he saw our
artillerymen some of whom were fighting while others having abandoned
their guns were running toward him he also saw french infantry
soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns
round prince andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces
of the cannon he heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and
to right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped but
he did not look at them he looked only at what was going on in front
of him at the battery he now saw clearly the figure of a red haired
gunner with his shako knocked awry pulling one end of a mop while
a french soldier tugged at the other he could distinctly see the
distraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men who
evidently did not realize what they were doing 

 what are they about thought prince andrew as he gazed at them 
 why doesn t the red haired gunner run away as he is unarmed 
why doesn t the frenchman stab him he will not get away before the
frenchman remembers his bayonet and stabs him 

and really another french soldier trailing his musket ran up to
the struggling men and the fate of the red haired gunner who had
triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him 
was about to be decided but prince andrew did not see how it ended it
seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head
with the full swing of a bludgeon it hurt a little but the worst of
it was that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he had
been looking at 

 what s this am i falling my legs are giving way thought he 
and fell on his back he opened his eyes hoping to see how the struggle
of the frenchmen with the gunners ended whether the red haired gunner
had been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or
saved but he saw nothing above him there was now nothing but the
sky the lofty sky not clear yet still immeasurably lofty with gray
clouds gliding slowly across it how quiet peaceful and solemn not
at all as i ran thought prince andrew not as we ran shouting
and fighting not at all as the gunner and the frenchman with frightened
and angry faces struggled for the mop how differently do those clouds
glide across that lofty infinite sky how was it i did not see that
lofty sky before and how happy i am to have found it at last yes all
is vanity all falsehood except that infinite sky there is nothing 
nothing but that but even it does not exist there is nothing but
quiet and peace thank god 





chapter xvii

on our right flank commanded by bagrati n at nine o clock the battle
had not yet begun not wishing to agree to dolgor kov s demand to
commence the action and wishing to avert responsibility from himself 
prince bagrati n proposed to dolgor kov to send to inquire of the
commander in chief bagrati n knew that as the distance between the two
flanks was more than six miles even if the messenger were not killed
 which he very likely would be and found the commander in chief
 which would be very difficult he would not be able to get back before
evening 

bagrati n cast his large expressionless sleepy eyes round his suite 
and the boyish face rost v breathless with excitement and hope was
the first to catch his eye he sent him 

 and if i should meet his majesty before i meet the commander in
chief your excellency said rost v with his hand to his cap 

 you can give the message to his majesty said dolgor kov 
hurriedly interrupting bagrati n 

on being relieved from picket duty rost v had managed to get a few
hours sleep before morning and felt cheerful bold and resolute 
with elasticity of movement faith in his good fortune and generally in
that state of mind which makes everything seem possible pleasant and
easy 

all his wishes were being fulfilled that morning there was to be a
general engagement in which he was taking part more than that he was
orderly to the bravest general and still more he was going with a
message to kut zov perhaps even to the sovereign himself the morning
was bright he had a good horse under him and his heart was full of
joy and happiness on receiving the order he gave his horse the rein
and galloped along the line at first he rode along the line of
bagrati n s troops which had not yet advanced into action but were
standing motionless then he came to the region occupied by uv rov s
cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle 
having passed uv rov s cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon
and musketry ahead of him the firing grew louder and louder 

in the fresh morning air were now heard not two or three musket shots
at irregular intervals as before followed by one or two cannon shots 
but a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before
pratzen interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes
several of them were not separated from one another but merged into a
general roar 

he could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one another
down the hillsides and clouds of cannon smoke rolling spreading 
and mingling with one another he could also by the gleam of bayonets
visible through the smoke make out moving masses of infantry and narrow
lines of artillery with green caissons 

rost v stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was
going on but strain his attention as he would he could not understand
or make out anything of what was happening there in the smoke men of
some sort were moving about in front and behind moved lines of troops 
but why whither and who they were it was impossible to make out 
these sights and sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him 
on the contrary they stimulated his energy and determination 

 go on go on give it them he mentally exclaimed at these sounds 
and again proceeded to gallop along the line penetrating farther and
farther into the region where the army was already in action 

 how it will be there i don t know but all will be well thought
rost v 

after passing some austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the
line the guards was already in action 

 so much the better i shall see it close he thought 

he was riding almost along the front line a handful of men came
galloping toward him they were our uhlans who with disordered
ranks were returning from the attack rost v got out of their way 
involuntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding and galloped on 

 that is no business of mine he thought he had not ridden many
hundred yards after that before he saw to his left across the whole
width of the field an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white
uniforms mounted on black horses trotting straight toward him and
across his path rost v put his horse to full gallop to get out of the
way of these men and he would have got clear had they continued at the
same speed but they kept increasing their pace so that some of the
horses were already galloping rost v heard the thud of their hoofs
and the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses their figures and
even their faces more and more distinctly they were our horse guards 
advancing to attack the french cavalry that was coming to meet them 

the horse guards were galloping but still holding in their horses 
rost v could already see their faces and heard the command 
 charge shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to
full speed rost v fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on
the french galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go but
still was not in time to avoid them 

the last of the horse guards a huge pockmarked fellow frowned angrily
on seeing rost v before him with whom he would inevitably collide 
this guardsman would certainly have bowled rost v and his bedouin over
 rost v felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men
and horses had it not occurred to rost v to flourish his whip before
the eyes of the guardsman s horse the heavy black horse sixteen
hands high shied throwing back its ears but the pockmarked guardsman
drove his huge spurs in violently and the horse flourishing its tail
and extending its neck galloped on yet faster hardly had the horse
guards passed rost v before he heard them shout hurrah and
looking back saw that their foremost ranks were mixed up with some
foreign cavalry with red epaulets probably french he could see nothing
more for immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and
smoke enveloped everything 

at that moment as the horse guards having passed him disappeared in
the smoke rost v hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where
he was sent this was the brilliant charge of the horse guards that
amazed the french themselves rost v was horrified to hear later that
of all that mass of huge and handsome men of all those brilliant 
rich youths officers and cadets who had galloped past him on their
thousand ruble horses only eighteen were left after the charge 

 why should i envy them my chance is not lost and maybe i shall see
the emperor immediately thought rost v and galloped on 

when he came level with the foot guards he noticed that about them and
around them cannon balls were flying of which he was aware not so
much because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on
the soldiers faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the
officers 

passing behind one of the lines of a regiment of foot guards he heard a
voice calling him by name 

 rost v 

 what he answered not recognizing bor s 

 i say we ve been in the front line our regiment attacked said
bor s with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been
under fire for the first time 

rost v stopped 

 have you he said well how did it go 

 we drove them back said bor s with animation growing talkative 
 can you imagine it and he began describing how the guards having
taken up their position and seeing troops before them thought they were
austrians and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged
by those troops that they were themselves in the front line and had
unexpectedly to go into action rost v without hearing bor s to the
end spurred his horse 

 where are you off to asked bor s 

 with a message to his majesty 

 there he is said bor s thinking rost v had said his
highness and pointing to the grand duke who with his high shoulders
and frowning brows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet
and horse guards jacket shouting something to a pale white
uniformed austrian officer 

 but that s the grand duke and i want the commander in chief or the
emperor said rost v and was about to spur his horse 

 count count shouted berg who ran up from the other side as eager
as bor s count i am wounded in my right hand and he showed his
bleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it and i remained at
the front i held my sword in my left hand count all our family the
von bergs have been knights 

he said something more but rost v did not wait to hear it and rode
away 

having passed the guards and traversed an empty space rost v to avoid
again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the horse
guards charged followed the line of reserves going far round the place
where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard suddenly he
heard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troops 
where he could never have expected the enemy to be 

 what can it be he thought the enemy in the rear of our army 
impossible and suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself
and for the issue of the whole battle but be that what it may 
he reflected there is no riding round it now i must look for the
commander in chief here and if all is lost it is for me to perish with
the rest 

the foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over rost v was more and
more confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village of
pratzen which was full of troops of all kinds 

 what does it mean what is it whom are they firing at who is
firing rost v kept asking as he came up to russian and austrian
soldiers running in confused crowds across his path 

 the devil knows they ve killed everybody it s all up now 
he was told in russian german and czech by the crowd of fugitives who
understood what was happening as little as he did 

 kill the germans shouted one 

 may the devil take them the traitors 

 zum henker diese russen muttered a german 

 hang these russians 


several wounded men passed along the road and words of abuse screams 
and groans mingled in a general hubbub then the firing died down 
rost v learned later that russian and austrian soldiers had been firing
at one another 

 my god what does it all mean thought he and here where at
any moment the emperor may see them but no these must be only a
handful of scoundrels it will soon be over it can t be that it
can t be only to get past them quicker quicker 

the idea of defeat and flight could not enter rost v s head though
he saw french cannon and french troops on the pratzen heights just where
he had been ordered to look for the commander in chief he could not 
did not wish to believe that 





chapter xviii

rost v had been ordered to look for kut zov and the emperor near the
village of pratzen but neither they nor a single commanding officer
were there only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds he
urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds but
the farther he went the more disorganized they were the highroad on
which he had come out was thronged with cal ches carriages of all
sorts and russian and austrian soldiers of all arms some wounded and
some not this whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the
dismal influence of cannon balls flying from the french batteries
stationed on the pratzen heights 

 where is the emperor where is kut zov rost v kept asking
everyone he could stop but got no answer from anyone 

at last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer 

 eh brother they ve all bolted long ago said the soldier 
laughing for some reason and shaking himself free 

having left that soldier who was evidently drunk rost v stopped the
horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to
question him the man announced that the tsar had been driven in a
carriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and
that he was dangerously wounded 

 it can t be said rost v it must have been someone else 

 i saw him myself replied the man with a self confident smile of
derision i ought to know the emperor by now after the times i ve
seen him in petersburg i saw him just as i see you there he sat in
the carriage as pale as anything how they made the four black horses
fly gracious me they did rattle past it s time i knew the imperial
horses and ily iv nych i don t think ily drives anyone except
the tsar 

rost v let go of the horse and was about to ride on when a wounded
officer passing by addressed him 

 who is it you want he asked the commander in chief he was
killed by a cannon ball struck in the breast before our regiment 

 not killed wounded another officer corrected him 

 who kut zov asked rost v 

 not kut zov but what s his name well never mind there are
not many left alive go that way to that village all the commanders
are there said the officer pointing to the village of hosjeradek 
and he walked on 

rost v rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now
going the emperor was wounded the battle lost it was impossible to
doubt it now rost v rode in the direction pointed out to him in which
he saw turrets and a church what need to hurry what was he now to say
to the tsar or to kut zov even if they were alive and unwounded 

 take this road your honor that way you will be killed at once a
soldier shouted to him they d kill you there 

 oh what are you talking about said another where is he to
go that way is nearer 

rost v considered and then went in the direction where they said he
would be killed 

 it s all the same now if the emperor is wounded am i to try to
save myself he thought he rode on to the region where the greatest
number of men had perished in fleeing from pratzen the french had not
yet occupied that region and the russians the uninjured and slightly
wounded had left it long ago all about the field like heaps of
manure on well kept plowland lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded
to each couple of acres the wounded crept together in twos and threes
and one could hear their distressing screams and groans sometimes
feigned or so it seemed to rost v he put his horse to a trot to
avoid seeing all these suffering men and he felt afraid afraid not
for his life but for the courage he needed and which he knew would not
stand the sight of these unfortunates 

the french who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and
wounded where there was no one left to fire at on seeing an adjutant
riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots the
sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around
him merged in rost v s mind into a single feeling of terror and pity
for himself he remembered his mother s last letter what would she
feel thought he if she saw me here now on this field with the
cannon aimed at me 

in the village of hosjeradek there were russian troops retiring from
the field of battle who though still in some confusion were less
disordered the french cannon did not reach there and the musketry fire
sounded far away here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle
was lost no one whom rost v asked could tell him where the emperor
or kut zov was some said the report that the emperor was wounded was
correct others that it was not and explained the false rumor that had
spread by the fact that the emperor s carriage had really galloped
from the field of battle with the pale and terrified ober hofmarschal
count tolst y who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in
the emperor s suite one officer told rost v that he had seen someone
from headquarters behind the village to the left and thither rost v
rode not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience when
he had ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the russian
troops he saw near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it two men
on horseback facing the ditch one with a white plume in his hat seemed
familiar to rost v the other on a beautiful chestnut horse which
rost v fancied he had seen before rode up to the ditch struck his
horse with his spurs and giving it the rein leaped lightly over only
a little earth crumbled from the bank under the horse s hind hoofs 
turning the horse sharply he again jumped the ditch and deferentially
addressed the horseman with the white plumes evidently suggesting
that he should do the same the rider whose figure seemed familiar
to rost v and involuntarily riveted his attention made a gesture of
refusal with his head and hand and by that gesture rost v instantly
recognized his lamented and adored monarch 

 but it can t be he alone in the midst of this empty field 
thought rost v at that moment alexander turned his head and rost v
saw the beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory the
emperor was pale his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow but the charm 
the mildness of his features was all the greater rost v was happy
in the assurance that the rumors about the emperor being wounded were
false he was happy to be seeing him he knew that he might and even
ought to go straight to him and give the message dolgor kov had ordered
him to deliver 

but as a youth in love trembles is unnerved and dares not utter the
thoughts he has dreamed of for nights but looks around for help or a
chance of delay and flight when the longed for moment comes and he is
alone with her so rost v now that he had attained what he had longed
for more than anything else in the world did not know how to approach
the emperor and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be
inconvenient unseemly and impossible to do so 

 what it is as if i were glad of a chance to take advantage of
his being alone and despondent a strange face may seem unpleasant or
painful to him at this moment of sorrow besides what can i say to him
now when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight
of him not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the emperor
that he had composed in his imagination could he now recall those
speeches were intended for quite other conditions they were for the
most part to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph generally
when he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic
deeds and while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved 

 besides how can i ask the emperor for his instructions for the right
flank now that it is nearly four o clock and the battle is lost 
no certainly i must not approach him i must not intrude on his
reflections better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind
look or bad opinion from him rost v decided and sorrowfully and
with a heart full despair he rode away continually looking back at the
tsar who still remained in the same attitude of indecision 

while rost v was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away 
captain von toll chanced to ride to the same spot and seeing the
emperor at once rode up to him offered his services and assisted him
to cross the ditch on foot the emperor wishing to rest and feeling
unwell sat down under an apple tree and von toll remained beside him 
rost v from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von toll spoke
long and warmly to the emperor and how the emperor evidently weeping 
covered his eyes with his hand and pressed von toll s hand 

 and i might have been in his place thought rost v and hardly
restraining his tears of pity for the emperor he rode on in utter
despair not knowing where to or why he was now riding 

his despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was
the cause of his grief 

he might not only might but should have gone up to the sovereign it
was a unique chance to show his devotion to the emperor and he had not
made use of it what have i done thought he and he turned
round and galloped back to the place where he had seen the emperor but
there was no one beyond the ditch now only some carts and carriages
were passing by from one of the drivers he learned that kut zov s
staff were not far off in the village the vehicles were going to 
rost v followed them in front of him walked kut zov s groom leading
horses in horsecloths then came a cart and behind that walked an old 
bandy legged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat 

 tit i say tit said the groom 

 what answered the old man absent mindedly 

 go tit thresh a bit 

 oh you fool said the old man spitting angrily some time passed
in silence and then the same joke was repeated 


before five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points more
than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the french 

przebysz wski and his corps had laid down their arms other columns
after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused
masses 

the remains of langeron s and dokht rov s mingled forces were
crowding around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of
augesd 

after five o clock it was only at the augesd dam that a hot cannonade
 delivered by the french alone was still to be heard from numerous
batteries ranged on the slopes of the pratzen heights directed at our
retreating forces 

in the rearguard dokht rov and others rallying some battalions kept up
a musketry fire at the french cavalry that was pursuing our troops it
was growing dusk on the narrow augesd dam where for so many years the
old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully
angling while his grandson with shirt sleeves rolled up handled the
floundering silvery fish in the watering can on that dam over which for
so many years moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully
driven their two horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty
with flour whitening their carts on that narrow dam amid the wagons
and the cannon under the horses hoofs and between the wagon wheels 
men disfigured by fear of death now crowded together crushing one
another dying stepping over the dying and killing one another only to
move on a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way 

every ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around or
a shell burst in the midst of that dense throng killing some and
splashing with blood those near them 

d lokhov now an officer wounded in the arm and on foot with
the regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company 
represented all that was left of that whole regiment impelled by the
crowd they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and jammed in
on all sides had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a
cannon and the crowd were dragging it out a cannon ball killed someone
behind them another fell in front and splashed d lokhov with blood 
the crowd pushing forward desperately squeezed together moved a few
steps and again stopped 

 move on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved remain here
another two minutes and it is certain death thought each one 

d lokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the edge
of the dam throwing two soldiers off their feet and ran onto the
slippery ice that covered the millpool 

 turn this way he shouted jumping over the ice which creaked
under him turn this way he shouted to those with the gun it
bears 

the ice bore him but it swayed and creaked and it was plain that it
would give way not only under a cannon or a crowd but very soon even
under his weight alone the men looked at him and pressed to the
bank hesitating to step onto the ice the general on horseback at the
entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address
d lokhov suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd that
everyone ducked it flopped into something moist and the general fell
from his horse in a pool of blood nobody gave him a look or thought of
raising him 

 get onto the ice over the ice go on turn don t you hear go
on innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck
the general the men themselves not knowing what or why they were
shouting 

one of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the
ice crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond 
the ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers and one leg slipped
into the water he tried to right himself but fell in up to his waist 
the nearest soldiers shrank back the gun driver stopped his horse but
from behind still came the shouts onto the ice why do you stop go
on go on and cries of horror were heard in the crowd the soldiers
near the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and
move on the horses moved off the bank the ice that had held under
those on foot collapsed in a great mass and some forty men who were on
it dashed some forward and some back drowning one another 

still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the
ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that covered
the dam the pond and the bank 





chapter xix

on the pratzen heights where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his
hand lay prince andrew bolk nski bleeding profusely and unconsciously
uttering a gentle piteous and childlike moan 

toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still he did not know
how long his unconsciousness lasted suddenly he again felt that he was
alive and suffering from a burning lacerating pain in his head 

 where is it that lofty sky that i did not know till now but saw
today was his first thought and i did not know this suffering
either he thought yes i did not know anything anything at all
till now but where am i 

he listened and heard the sound of approaching horses and voices
speaking french he opened his eyes above him again was the same lofty
sky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher and
between them gleamed blue infinity he did not turn his head and did not
see those who judging by the sound of hoofs and voices had ridden up
and stopped near him 

it was napoleon accompanied by two aides de camp bonaparte riding
over the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries
firing at the augesd dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left
on the field 

 fine men remarked napoleon looking at a dead russian grenadier 
who with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape lay on his
stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide 

 the ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted your
majesty said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were
firing at augesd 

 have some brought from the reserve said napoleon and having gone
on a few steps he stopped before prince andrew who lay on his back with
the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him the flag had already
been taken by the french as a trophy 

 that s a fine death said napoleon as he gazed at bolk nski 

prince andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was
napoleon who said it he heard the speaker addressed as sire but he
heard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly not only
did they not interest him but he took no notice of them and at once
forgot them his head was burning he felt himself bleeding to death 
and he saw above him the remote lofty and everlasting sky he knew it
was napoleon his hero but at that moment napoleon seemed to him
such a small insignificant creature compared with what was passing now
between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over
it at that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over
him or what was said of him he was only glad that people were standing
near him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to
life which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to
understand it so differently he collected all his strength to stir and
utter a sound he feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak sickly groan
which aroused his own pity 

 ah he is alive said napoleon lift this young man up and
carry him to the dressing station 

having said this napoleon rode on to meet marshal lannes who hat in
hand rode up smiling to the emperor to congratulate him on the victory 

prince andrew remembered nothing more he lost consciousness from the
terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher the jolting while
being moved and the probing of his wound at the dressing station 
he did not regain consciousness till late in the day when with other
wounded and captured russian officers he was carried to the hospital 
during this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look
about him and even speak 

the first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a french
convoy officer who said rapidly we must halt here the emperor
will pass here immediately it will please him to see these gentlemen
prisoners 

 there are so many prisoners today nearly the whole russian army 
that he is probably tired of them said another officer 

 all the same they say this one is the commander of all the emperor
alexander s guards said the first one indicating a russian
officer in the white uniform of the horse guards 

bolk nski recognized prince repn n whom he had met in petersburg
society beside him stood a lad of nineteen also a wounded officer of
the horse guards 

bonaparte having come up at a gallop stopped his horse 

 which is the senior he asked on seeing the prisoners 

they named the colonel prince repn n 

 you are the commander of the emperor alexander s regiment of horse
guards asked napoleon 

 i commanded a squadron replied repn n 

 your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably said napoleon 

 the praise of a great commander is a soldier s highest reward 
said repn n 

 i bestow it with pleasure said napoleon and who is that young
man beside you 

prince repn n named lieutenant sukht len 

after looking at him napoleon smiled 

 he s very young to come to meddle with us 

 youth is no hindrance to courage muttered sukht len in a failing
voice 

 a splendid reply said napoleon young man you will go far 

prince andrew who had also been brought forward before the emperor s
eyes to complete the show of prisoners could not fail to attract his
attention napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield
and addressing him again used the epithet young man that was
connected in his memory with prince andrew 

 well and you young man said he how do you feel mon
brave 

though five minutes before prince andrew had been able to say a few
words to the soldiers who were carrying him now with his eyes fixed
straight on napoleon he was silent so insignificant at that moment
seemed to him all the interests that engrossed napoleon so mean did his
hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear 
compared to the lofty equitable and kindly sky which he had seen and
understood that he could not answer him 

everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the
stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood 
suffering and the nearness of death aroused in him looking into
napoleon s eyes prince andrew thought of the insignificance of
greatness the unimportance of life which no one could understand and
the still greater unimportance of death the meaning of which no one
alive could understand or explain 

the emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of
the officers as he went have these gentlemen attended to and taken
to my bivouac let my doctor larrey examine their wounds au revoir 
prince repn n and he spurred his horse and galloped away 

his face shone with self satisfaction and pleasure 

the soldiers who had carried prince andrew had noticed and taken the
little gold icon princess mary had hung round her brother s neck but
seeing the favor the emperor showed the prisoners they now hastened to
return the holy image 

prince andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced but the
little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest
outside his uniform 

 it would be good thought prince andrew glancing at the icon his
sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence it
would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to
mary how good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life 
and what to expect after it beyond the grave how happy and calm i
should be if i could now say lord have mercy on me but to
whom should i say that either to a power indefinable incomprehensible 
which i not only cannot address but which i cannot even express in
words the great all or nothing said he to himself or to
that god who has been sewn into this amulet by mary there is nothing
certain nothing at all except the unimportance of everything i
understand and the greatness of something incomprehensible but
all important 

the stretchers moved on at every jolt he again felt unendurable pain 
his feverishness increased and he grew delirious visions of his father 
wife sister and future son and the tenderness he had felt the night
before the battle the figure of the insignificant little napoleon and
above all this the lofty sky formed the chief subjects of his delirious
fancies 

the quiet home life and peaceful happiness of bald hills presented
itself to him he was already enjoying that happiness when that
little napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of
shortsighted delight at the misery of others and doubts and torments
had followed and only the heavens promised peace toward morning
all these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of
unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of napoleon s doctor 
larrey was much more likely to end in death than in convalescence 

 he is a nervous bilious subject said larrey and will not
recover 

and prince andrew with others fatally wounded was left to the care of
the inhabitants of the district 





book four 1806





chapter i

early in the year 1806 nicholas rost v returned home on leave den sov
was going home to vor nezh and rost v persuaded him to travel with him
as far as moscow and to stay with him there meeting a comrade at
the last post station but one before moscow den sov had drunk three
bottles of wine with him and despite the jolting ruts across the
snow covered road did not once wake up on the way to moscow but lay
at the bottom of the sleigh beside rost v who grew more and more
impatient the nearer they got to moscow 

 how much longer how much longer oh these insufferable streets 
shops bakers signboards street lamps and sleighs thought
rost v when their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and
they had entered moscow 

 den sov we re here he s asleep he added leaning forward
with his whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed
of the sleigh 

den sov gave no answer 

 there s the corner at the crossroads where the cabman zakh r 
has his stand and there s zakh r himself and still the same horse 
and here s the little shop where we used to buy gingerbread can t
you hurry up now then 

 which house is it asked the driver 

 why that one right at the end the big one don t you see 
that s our house said rost v of course it s our house 
den sov den sov we re almost there 

den sov raised his head coughed and made no answer 

 dm tri said rost v to his valet on the box those lights are
in our house aren t they 

 yes sir and there s a light in your father s study 

 then they ve not gone to bed yet what do you think mind now 
don t forget to put out my new coat added rost v fingering his
new mustache now then get on he shouted to the driver do
wake up v ska he went on turning to den sov whose head
was again nodding come get on you shall have three rubles for
vodka get on rost v shouted when the sleigh was only three
houses from his door it seemed to him the horses were not moving at
all at last the sleigh bore to the right drew up at an entrance and
rost v saw overhead the old familiar cornice with a bit of plaster
broken off the porch and the post by the side of the pavement he
sprang out before the sleigh stopped and ran into the hall the house
stood cold and silent as if quite regardless of who had come to it 
there was no one in the hall oh god is everyone all right 
he thought stopping for a moment with a sinking heart and then
immediately starting to run along the hall and up the warped steps of
the familiar staircase the well known old door handle which always
angered the countess when it was not properly cleaned turned as loosely
as ever a solitary tallow candle burned in the anteroom 

old michael was asleep on the chest prok fy the footman who was
so strong that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind sat
plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges he looked up at the opening
door and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly changed to one
of delighted amazement 

 gracious heavens the young count he cried recognizing his
young master can it be my treasure and prok fy trembling with
excitement rushed toward the drawing room door probably in order to
announce him but changing his mind came back and stooped to kiss the
young man s shoulder 

 all well asked rost v drawing away his arm 

 yes god be thanked yes they ve just finished supper let me have
a look at you your excellency 

 is everything quite all right 

 the lord be thanked yes 

rost v who had completely forgotten den sov not wishing anyone to
forestall him threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the
large dark ballroom all was the same there were the same old card
tables and the same chandelier with a cover over it but someone had
already seen the young master and before he had reached the drawing
room something flew out from a side door like a tornado and began
hugging and kissing him another and yet another creature of the same
kind sprang from a second door and a third more hugging more kissing 
more outcries and tears of joy he could not distinguish which was
papa which nat sha and which p tya everyone shouted talked and
kissed him at the same time only his mother was not there he noticed
that 

 and i did not know nicholas my darling 

 here he is our own k lya dear fellow how he has
changed where are the candles tea 

 nicholas 

 and me kiss me 

 dearest and me 

s nya nat sha p tya anna mikh ylovna v ra and the old count
were all hugging him and the serfs men and maids flocked into the
room exclaiming and oh ing and ah ing 

p tya clinging to his legs kept shouting and me too 

nat sha after she had pulled him down toward her and covered his face
with kisses holding him tight by the skirt of his coat sprang away and
pranced up and down in one place like a goat and shrieked piercingly 

all around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy and all around
were lips seeking a kiss 

s nya too all rosy red clung to his arm and radiant with bliss 
looked eagerly toward his eyes waiting for the look for which she
longed s nya now was sixteen and she was very pretty especially at
this moment of happy rapturous excitement she gazed at him not taking
her eyes off him and smiling and holding her breath he gave her a
grateful look but was still expectant and looking for someone the old
countess had not yet come but now steps were heard at the door steps
so rapid that they could hardly be his mother s 

yet it was she dressed in a new gown which he did not know made since
he had left all the others let him go and he ran to her when they
met she fell on his breast sobbing she could not lift her face but
only pressed it to the cold braiding of his hussar s jacket den sov 
who had come into the room unnoticed by anyone stood there and wiped
his eyes at the sight 

 vas li den sov your son s friend he said introducing
himself to the count who was looking inquiringly at him 

 you are most welcome i know i know said the count kissing and
embracing den sov nicholas wrote us nat sha v ra look here
is den sov 

the same happy rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure of den sov 

 darling den sov screamed nat sha beside herself with rapture 
springing to him putting her arms round him and kissing him this
escapade made everybody feel confused den sov blushed too but smiled
and taking nat sha s hand kissed it 

den sov was shown to the room prepared for him and the rost vs all
gathered round nicholas in the sitting room 

the old countess not letting go of his hand and kissing it every
moment sat beside him the rest crowding round him watched every
movement word or look of his never taking their blissfully adoring
eyes off him his brother and sisters struggled for the places nearest
to him and disputed with one another who should bring him his tea 
handkerchief and pipe 

rost v was very happy in the love they showed him but the first
moment of meeting had been so beatific that his present joy seemed
insufficient and he kept expecting something more more and yet more 

next morning after the fatigues of their journey the travelers slept
till ten o clock 

in the room next their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers 
satchels sabretaches open portmanteaus and dirty boots two freshly
cleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall the servants
were bringing in jugs and basins hot water for shaving and their
well brushed clothes there was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco 

 hallo gw ska my pipe came vas li den sov s husky voice 
 wost v get up 

rost v rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together raised his
disheveled head from the hot pillow 

 why is it late 

 late it s nearly ten o clock answered nat sha s voice 
a rustle of starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of
girls voices came from the adjoining room the door was opened a
crack and there was a glimpse of something blue of ribbons black hair 
and merry faces it was nat sha s nya and p tya who had come to
see whether they were getting up 

 nicholas get up nat sha s voice was again heard at the door 

 directly 

meanwhile p tya having found and seized the sabers in the outer room 
with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother and
forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed 
opened the bedroom door 

 is this your saber he shouted 

the girls sprang aside den sov hid his hairy legs under the blanket 
looking with a scared face at his comrade for help the door having let
p tya in closed again a sound of laughter came from behind it 

 nicholas come out in your dressing gown said nat sha s voice 

 is this your saber asked p tya or is it yours he said 
addressing the black mustached den sov with servile deference 

rost v hurriedly put something on his feet drew on his dressing gown 
and went out nat sha had put on one spurred boot and was just getting
her foot into the other s nya when he came in was twirling round and
was about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit down they were
dressed alike in new pale blue frocks and were both fresh rosy and
bright s nya ran away but nat sha taking her brother s arm led
him into the sitting room where they began talking they hardly gave
one another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand
little matters which could not interest anyone but themselves nat sha
laughed at every word he said or that she said herself not because what
they were saying was amusing but because she felt happy and was unable
to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter 

 oh how nice how splendid she said to everything 

rost v felt that under the influence of the warm rays of love that
childlike smile which had not once appeared on his face since he left
home now for the first time after eighteen months again brightened his
soul and his face 

 no but listen she said now you are quite a man aren t
you i m awfully glad you re my brother she touched his
mustache i want to know what you men are like are you the same as
we no 

 why did s nya run away asked rost v 

 ah yes that s a whole long story how are you going to speak to
her thou or you 

 as may happen said rost v 

 no call her you please i ll tell you all about it some other
time no i ll tell you now you know s nya s my dearest friend 
such a friend that i burned my arm for her sake look here 

she pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her long 
slender delicate arm high above the elbow on that part that is covered
even by a ball dress 

 i burned this to prove my love for her i just heated a ruler in the
fire and pressed it there 

sitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms in what used
to be his old schoolroom and looking into nat sha s wildly bright
eyes rost v re entered that world of home and childhood which had no
meaning for anyone else but gave him some of the best joys of his life 
and the burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of love did not seem
to him senseless he understood and was not surprised at it 

 well and is that all he asked 

 we are such friends such friends all that ruler business was just
nonsense but we are friends forever she if she loves anyone does it
for life but i don t understand that i forget quickly 

 well what then 

 well she loves me and you like that 

nat sha suddenly flushed 

 why you remember before you went away well she says you are to
forget all that she says i shall love him always but let him be
free isn t that lovely and noble yes very noble isn t it 
asked nat sha so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that what
she was now saying she had talked of before with tears 

rost v became thoughtful 

 i never go back on my word he said besides s nya is so
charming that only a fool would renounce such happiness 

 no no cried nat sha she and i have already talked it over 
we knew you d say so but it won t do because you see if you say
that if you consider yourself bound by your promise it will seem as
if she had not meant it seriously it makes it as if you were marrying
her because you must and that wouldn t do at all 

rost v saw that it had been well considered by them s nya had already
struck him by her beauty on the preceding day today when he had caught
a glimpse of her she seemed still more lovely she was a charming girl
of sixteen evidently passionately in love with him he did not doubt
that for an instant why should he not love her now and even marry
her rost v thought but just now there were so many other pleasures
and interests before him yes they have taken a wise decision he
thought i must remain free 

 well then that s excellent said he we ll talk it over
later on oh how glad i am to have you 

 well and are you still true to bor s he continued 

 oh what nonsense cried nat sha laughing i don t think
about him or anyone else and i don t want anything of the kind 

 dear me then what are you up to now 

 now repeated nat sha and a happy smile lit up her face have
you seen duport 

 no 

 not seen duport the famous dancer well then you won t
understand that s what i m up to 

curving her arms nat sha held out her skirts as dancers do ran back
a few steps turned cut a caper brought her little feet sharply
together and made some steps on the very tips of her toes 

 see i m standing see she said but could not maintain herself
on her toes any longer so that s what i m up to i ll never
marry anyone but will be a dancer only don t tell anyone 

rost v laughed so loud and merrily that den sov in his bedroom felt
envious and nat sha could not help joining in 

 no but don t you think it s nice she kept repeating 

 nice and so you no longer wish to marry bor s 

nat sha flared up i don t want to marry anyone and i ll tell
him so when i see him 

 dear me said rost v 

 but that s all rubbish nat sha chattered on and is
den sov nice she asked 

 yes indeed 

 oh well then good by go and dress is he very terrible 
den sov 

 why terrible asked nicholas no v ska is a splendid
fellow 

 you call him v ska that s funny and is he very nice 

 very 

 well then be quick we ll all have breakfast together 

and nat sha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe like a ballet
dancer but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile when
rost v met s nya in the drawing room he reddened he did not know
how to behave with her the evening before in the first happy moment of
meeting they had kissed each other but today they felt it could not
be done he felt that everybody including his mother and sisters was
looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave
with her he kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as
you s nya but their eyes met and said thou and exchanged tender
kisses her looks asked him to forgive her for having dared by
nat sha s intermediacy to remind him of his promise and then
thanked him for his love his looks thanked her for offering him his
freedom and told her that one way or another he would never cease to
love her for that would be impossible 

 how strange it is said v ra selecting a moment when all were
silent that s nya and nicholas now say you to one another and meet
like strangers 

v ra s remark was correct as her remarks always were but like
most of her observations it made everyone feel uncomfortable not
only s nya nicholas and nat sha but even the old countess 
who dreading this love affair which might hinder nicholas from making
a brilliant match blushed like a girl 

den sov to rost v s surprise appeared in the drawing room with
pomaded hair perfumed and in a new uniform looking just as smart as
he made himself when going into battle and he was more amiable to the
ladies and gentlemen than rost v had ever expected to see him 





chapter ii

on his return to moscow from the army nicholas rost v was welcomed
by his home circle as the best of sons a hero and their darling
nik lenka by his relations as a charming attractive and polite young
man by his acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars a good
dancer and one of the best matches in the city 

the rost vs knew everybody in moscow the old count had money enough
that year as all his estates had been remortgaged and so nicholas 
acquiring a trotter of his own very stylish riding breeches of the
latest cut such as no one else yet had in moscow and boots of the
latest fashion with extremely pointed toes and small silver spurs 
passed his time very gaily after a short period of adapting himself
to the old conditions of life nicholas found it very pleasant to be
at home again he felt that he had grown up and matured very much his
despair at failing in a scripture examination his borrowing money from
gavr l to pay a sleigh driver his kissing s nya on the sly he now
recalled all this as childishness he had left immeasurably behind 
now he was a lieutenant of hussars in a jacket laced with silver and
wearing the cross of st george awarded to soldiers for bravery in
action and in the company of well known elderly and respected racing
men was training a trotter of his own for a race he knew a lady on one
of the boulevards whom he visited of an evening he led the mazurka
at the arkh rovs ball talked about the war with field marshal
k menski visited the english club and was on intimate terms with a
colonel of forty to whom den sov had introduced him 

his passion for the emperor had cooled somewhat in moscow but still as
he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him he often spoke
about him and about his love for him letting it be understood that he
had not told all and that there was something in his feelings for the
emperor not everyone could understand and with his whole soul he shared
the adoration then common in moscow for the emperor who was spoken of
as the angel incarnate 

during rost v s short stay in moscow before rejoining the army he
did not draw closer to s nya but rather drifted away from her she was
very pretty and sweet and evidently deeply in love with him but he was
at the period of youth when there seems so much to do that there is no
time for that sort of thing and a young man fears to bind himself and
prizes his freedom which he needs for so many other things when he
thought of s nya during this stay in moscow he said to himself 
 ah there will be and there are many more such girls somewhere whom
i do not yet know there will be time enough to think about love when i
want to but now i have no time besides it seemed to him that the
society of women was rather derogatory to his manhood he went to balls
and into ladies society with an affectation of doing so against his
will the races the english club sprees with den sov and visits to
a certain house that was another matter and quite the thing for a
dashing young hussar 

at the beginning of march old count ily rost v was very busy
arranging a dinner in honor of prince bagrati n at the english club 

the count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown giving
orders to the club steward and to the famous feokt st the club s
head cook about asparagus fresh cucumbers strawberries veal and
fish for this dinner the count had been a member and on the committee
of the club from the day it was founded to him the club entrusted the
arrangement of the festival in honor of bagrati n for few men knew
so well how to arrange a feast on an open handed hospitable scale 
and still fewer men would be so well able and willing to make up out of
their own resources what might be needed for the success of the fete 
the club cook and the steward listened to the count s orders with
pleased faces for they knew that under no other management could they
so easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner costing
several thousand rubles 

 well then mind and have cocks comb in the turtle soup you
know 

 shall we have three cold dishes then asked the cook 

the count considered 

 we can t have less yes three the mayonnaise that s one 
said he bending down a finger 

 then am i to order those large sterlets asked the steward 

 yes it can t be helped if they won t take less ah dear me i
was forgetting we must have another entr e ah goodness gracious 
he clutched at his head who is going to get me the flowers dm tri 
eh dm tri gallop off to our moscow estate he said to the factotum
who appeared at his call hurry off and tell maks m the gardener 
to set the serfs to work say that everything out of the hothouses must
be brought here well wrapped up in felt i must have two hundred pots
here on friday 

having given several more orders he was about to go to his little
countess to have a rest but remembering something else of
importance he returned again called back the cook and the club
steward and again began giving orders a light footstep and the
clinking of spurs were heard at the door and the young count handsome 
rosy with a dark little mustache evidently rested and made sleeker by
his easy life in moscow entered the room 

 ah my boy my head s in a whirl said the old man with a smile 
as if he felt a little confused before his son now if you would
only help a bit i must have singers too i shall have my own orchestra 
but shouldn t we get the gypsy singers as well you military men like
that sort of thing 

 really papa i believe prince bagrati n worried himself less before
the battle of sch n grabern than you do now said his son with a
smile 

the old count pretended to be angry 

 yes you talk but try it yourself 

and the count turned to the cook who with a shrewd and respectful
expression looked observantly and sympathetically at the father and
son 

 what have the young people come to nowadays eh feokt st said
he laughing at us old fellows 

 that s so your excellency all they have to do is to eat a good
dinner but providing it and serving it all up that s not their
business 

 that s it that s it exclaimed the count and gaily seizing
his son by both hands he cried now i ve got you so take the
sleigh and pair at once and go to bez khov s and tell him count
ily has sent you to ask for strawberries and fresh pineapples we
can t get them from anyone else he s not there himself so you ll
have to go in and ask the princesses and from there go on to the
rasguly y the coachman ip tka knows and look up the gypsy
ily shka the one who danced at count orl v s you remember in a
white cossack coat and bring him along to me 

 and am i to bring the gypsy girls along with him asked nicholas 
laughing dear dear 

at that moment with noiseless footsteps and with the businesslike 
preoccupied yet meekly christian look which never left her face anna
mikh ylovna entered the hall though she came upon the count in his
dressing gown every day he invariably became confused and begged her to
excuse his costume 

 no matter at all my dear count she said meekly closing her
eyes but i ll go to bez khov s myself pierre has arrived and
now we shall get anything we want from his hothouses i have to see him
in any case he has forwarded me a letter from bor s thank god bor s
is now on the staff 

the count was delighted at anna mikh ylovna s taking upon herself one
of his commissions and ordered the small closed carriage for her 

 tell bez khov to come i ll put his name down is his wife with
him he asked 

anna mikh ylovna turned up her eyes and profound sadness was depicted
on her face 

 ah my dear friend he is very unfortunate she said if what
we hear is true it is dreadful how little we dreamed of such a thing
when we were rejoicing at his happiness and such a lofty angelic soul
as young bez khov yes i pity him from my heart and shall try to give
him what consolation i can 

 wh what is the matter asked both the young and old rost v 

anna mikh ylovna sighed deeply 

 d lokhov mary iv novna s son she said in a mysterious
whisper has compromised her completely they say pierre took him
up invited him to his house in petersburg and now she has come here
and that daredevil after her said anna mikh ylovna wishing to show
her sympathy for pierre but by involuntary intonations and a half smile
betraying her sympathy for the daredevil as she called d lokhov 
 they say pierre is quite broken by his misfortune 

 dear dear but still tell him to come to the club it will all blow
over it will be a tremendous banquet 

next day the third of march soon after one o clock two hundred and
fifty members of the english club and fifty guests were awaiting the
guest of honor and hero of the austrian campaign prince bagrati n to
dinner 

on the first arrival of the news of the battle of austerlitz moscow had
been bewildered at that time the russians were so used to victories
that on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe it 
while others sought some extraordinary explanation of so strange an
event in the english club where all who were distinguished important 
and well informed foregathered when the news began to arrive in
december nothing was said about the war and the last battle as
though all were in a conspiracy of silence the men who set the tone
in conversation count rostopch n prince y ri dolgor kov val ev 
count mark v and prince vy zemski did not show themselves at the
club but met in private houses in intimate circles and the
moscovites who took their opinions from others ily rost v among
them remained for a while without any definite opinion on the subject
of the war and without leaders the moscovites felt that something was
wrong and that to discuss the bad news was difficult and so it was best
to be silent but after a while just as a jury comes out of its room 
the bigwigs who guided the club s opinion reappeared and everybody
began speaking clearly and definitely reasons were found for the
incredible unheard of and impossible event of a russian defeat 
everything became clear and in all corners of moscow the same things
began to be said these reasons were the treachery of the austrians a
defective commissariat the treachery of the pole przebysz wski and of
the frenchman langeron kut zov s incapacity and it was whispered 
the youth and inexperience of the sovereign who had trusted worthless
and insignificant people but the army the russian army everyone
declared was extraordinary and had achieved miracles of valor the
soldiers officers and generals were heroes but the hero of heroes was
prince bagrati n distinguished by his sch n grabern affair and by
the retreat from austerlitz where he alone had withdrawn his column
unbroken and had all day beaten back an enemy force twice as numerous
as his own what also conduced to bagrati n s being selected as
moscow s hero was the fact that he had no connections in the city
and was a stranger there in his person honor was shown to a simple
fighting russian soldier without connections and intrigues and to one
who was associated by memories of the italian campaign with the name of
suv rov moreover paying such honor to bagrati n was the best way of
expressing disapproval and dislike of kut zov 

 had there been no bagrati n it would have been necessary to
invent him said the wit shinsh n parodying the words of voltaire 
kut zov no one spoke of except some who abused him in whispers 
calling him a court weathercock and an old satyr 

all moscow repeated prince dolgor kov s saying if you go on
modeling and modeling you must get smeared with clay suggesting
consolation for our defeat by the memory of former victories and the
words of rostopch n that french soldiers have to be incited to battle
by highfalutin words and germans by logical arguments to show them
that it is more dangerous to run away than to advance but that russian
soldiers only need to be restrained and held back on all sides new and
fresh anecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown by
our officers and men at austerlitz one had saved a standard another
had killed five frenchmen a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded 
berg was mentioned by those who did not know him as having when
wounded in the right hand taken his sword in the left and gone
forward of bolk nski nothing was said and only those who knew him
intimately regretted that he had died so young leaving a pregnant wife
with his eccentric father 





chapter iii

on that third of march all the rooms in the english club were filled
with a hum of conversation like the hum of bees swarming in springtime 
the members and guests of the club wandered hither and thither sat 
stood met and separated some in uniform and some in evening dress 
and a few here and there with powdered hair and in russian kaft ns 
powdered footmen in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings 
stood at every door anxiously noting visitors every movement in order
to offer their services most of those present were elderly respected
men with broad self confident faces fat fingers and resolute gestures
and voices this class of guests and members sat in certain habitual
places and met in certain habitual groups a minority of those present
were casual guests chiefly young men among whom were den sov 
rost v and d lokhov who was now again an officer in the sem nov
regiment the faces of these young people especially those who were
military men bore that expression of condescending respect for their
elders which seems to say to the older generation we are prepared to
respect and honor you but all the same remember that the future belongs
to us 

nesv tski was there as an old member of the club pierre who at his
wife s command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles 
went about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull here 
as elsewhere he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to
his wealth and being in the habit of lording it over these people he
treated them with absent minded contempt 

by his age he should have belonged to the younger men but by his wealth
and connections he belonged to the groups of old and honored guests and
so he went from one group to another some of the most important old men
were the center of groups which even strangers approached respectfully
to hear the voices of well known men the largest circles formed round
count rostopch n val ev and nar shkin rostopch n was describing
how the russians had been overwhelmed by flying austrians and had had to
force their way through them with bayonets 

val ev was confidentially telling that uv rov had been sent from
petersburg to ascertain what moscow was thinking about austerlitz 

in the third circle nar shkin was speaking of the meeting of the
austrian council of war at which suv rov crowed like a cock in reply to
the nonsense talked by the austrian generals shinsh n standing close
by tried to make a joke saying that kut zov had evidently failed to
learn from suv rov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like a
cock but the elder members glanced severely at the wit making him
feel that in that place and on that day it was improper to speak so of
kut zov 

count ily rost v hurried and preoccupied went about in his soft
boots between the dining and drawing rooms hastily greeting the
important and unimportant all of whom he knew as if they were all
equals while his eyes occasionally sought out his fine well set up
young son resting on him and winking joyfully at him young rost v
stood at a window with d lokhov whose acquaintance he had lately
made and highly valued the old count came up to them and pressed
d lokhov s hand 

 please come and visit us you know my brave boy been together
out there both playing the hero ah vas li ign tovich 
how d ye do old fellow he said turning to an old man who was
passing but before he had finished his greeting there was a general
stir and a footman who had run in announced with a frightened face 
 he s arrived 

bells rang the stewards rushed forward and like rye shaken together
in a shovel the guests who had been scattered about in different rooms
came together and crowded in the large drawing room by the door of the
ballroom 

bagrati n appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or sword 
which in accord with the club custom he had given up to the hall
porter he had no lambskin cap on his head nor had he a loaded whip
over his shoulder as when rost v had seen him on the eve of the battle
of austerlitz but wore a tight new uniform with russian and foreign
orders and the star of st george on his left breast evidently just
before coming to the dinner he had had his hair and whiskers trimmed 
which changed his appearance for the worse there was something na vely
festive in his air which in conjunction with his firm and virile
features gave him a rather comical expression beklesh v and theodore
uv rov who had arrived with him paused at the doorway to allow him 
as the guest of honor to enter first bagrati n was embarrassed not
wishing to avail himself of their courtesy and this caused some delay
at the doors but after all he did at last enter first he walked shyly
and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room not knowing
what to do with his hands he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed
field under fire as he had done at the head of the kursk regiment at
sch n grabern and he would have found that easier the committeemen
met him at the first door and expressing their delight at seeing such a
highly honored guest took possession of him as it were without waiting
for his reply surrounded him and led him to the drawing room it was
at first impossible to enter the drawing room door for the crowd of
members and guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look
at bagrati n over each other s shoulders as if he were some rare
animal count ily rost v laughing and repeating the words make
way dear boy make way make way pushed through the crowd more
energetically than anyone led the guests into the drawing room and
seated them on the center sofa the bigwigs the most respected members
of the club beset the new arrivals count ily again thrusting his
way through the crowd went out of the drawing room and reappeared a
minute later with another committeeman carrying a large silver salver
which he presented to prince bagrati n on the salver lay some verses
composed and printed in the hero s honor bagrati n on seeing the
salver glanced around in dismay as though seeking help but all eyes
demanded that he should submit feeling himself in their power he
resolutely took the salver with both hands and looked sternly and
reproachfully at the count who had presented it to him someone
obligingly took the dish from bagrati n or he would it seemed have
held it till evening and have gone in to dinner with it and drew his
attention to the verses 

 well i will read them then bagrati n seemed to say and 
fixing his weary eyes on the paper began to read them with a fixed and
serious expression but the author himself took the verses and began
reading them aloud bagrati n bowed his head and listened 

 bring glory then to alexander s reign
 and on the throne our titus shield 
 a dreaded foe be thou kindhearted as a man 
 a rhipheus at home a caesar in the field 
 e en fortunate napoleon
 knows by experience now bagrati n 
 and dare not herculean russians trouble 

but before he had finished reading a stentorian major domo announced
that dinner was ready the door opened and from the dining room came
the resounding strains of the polonaise 

 conquest s joyful thunder waken 
 triumph valiant russians now 

and count rost v glancing angrily at the author who went on reading
his verses bowed to bagrati n everyone rose feeling that dinner
was more important than verses and bagrati n again preceding all the
rest went in to dinner he was seated in the place of honor between
two alexanders beklesh v and nar shkin which was a significant
allusion to the name of the sovereign three hundred persons took their
seats in the dining room according to their rank and importance the
more important nearer to the honored guest as naturally as water flows
deepest where the land lies lowest 

just before dinner count ily rost v presented his son to bagrati n 
who recognized him and said a few words to him disjointed and awkward 
as were all the words he spoke that day and count ily looked joyfully
and proudly around while bagrati n spoke to his son 

nicholas rost v with den sov and his new acquaintance d lokhov sat
almost at the middle of the table facing them sat pierre beside prince
nesv tski count ily rost v with the other members of the committee
sat facing bagrati n and as the very personification of moscow
hospitality did the honors to the prince 

his efforts had not been in vain the dinner both the lenten and the
other fare was splendid yet he could not feel quite at ease till the
end of the meal he winked at the butler whispered directions to the
footmen and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety everything
was excellent with the second course a gigantic sterlet at sight of
which ily rost v blushed with self conscious pleasure the footmen
began popping corks and filling the champagne glasses after the fish 
which made a certain sensation the count exchanged glances with
the other committeemen there will be many toasts it s time to
begin he whispered and taking up his glass he rose all were
silent waiting for what he would say 

 to the health of our sovereign the emperor he cried and at the
same moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasm 
the band immediately struck up conquest s joyful thunder
waken all rose and cried hurrah bagrati n also rose and
shouted hurrah in exactly the same voice in which he had shouted
it on the field at sch n grabern young rost v s ecstatic voice
could be heard above the three hundred others he nearly wept to the
health of our sovereign the emperor he roared hurrah and
emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to the floor many followed
his example and the loud shouting continued for a long time when the
voices subsided the footmen cleared away the broken glass and everybody
sat down again smiling at the noise they had made and exchanging
remarks the old count rose once more glanced at a note lying beside
his plate and proposed a toast to the health of the hero of our
last campaign prince peter iv novich bagrati n and again his blue
eyes grew moist hurrah cried the three hundred voices again 
but instead of the band a choir began singing a cantata composed by paul
iv novich kut zov 

 russians o er all barriers on 
 courage conquest guarantees 
 have we not bagrati n 
 he brings foemen to their knees etc 

as soon as the singing was over another and another toast was proposed
and count ily rost v became more and more moved more glass was
smashed and the shouting grew louder they drank to beklesh v 
nar shkin uv rov dolgor kov apr ksin val ev to the committee 
to all the club members and to all the club guests and finally to
count ily rost v separately as the organizer of the banquet at that
toast the count took out his handkerchief and covering his face wept
outright 





chapter iv

pierre sat opposite d lokhov and nicholas rost v as usual he ate and
drank much and eagerly but those who knew him intimately noticed that
some great change had come over him that day he was silent all through
dinner and looked about blinking and scowling or with fixed eyes and
a look of complete absent mindedness kept rubbing the bridge of his
nose his face was depressed and gloomy he seemed to see and hear
nothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by some
depressing and unsolved problem 

the unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by the
princess his cousin at moscow concerning d lokhov s intimacy with
his wife and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning which
in the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw
badly through his spectacles but that his wife s connection with
d lokhov was a secret to no one but himself pierre absolutely
disbelieved both the princess hints and the letter but he feared
now to look at d lokhov who was sitting opposite him every time
he chanced to meet d lokhov s handsome insolent eyes pierre felt
something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul and turned quickly
away involuntarily recalling his wife s past and her relations with
d lokhov pierre saw clearly that what was said in the letter might be
true or might at least seem to be true had it not referred to his wife 
he involuntarily remembered how d lokhov who had fully recovered his
former position after the campaign had returned to petersburg and come
to him availing himself of his friendly relations with pierre as a boon
companion d lokhov had come straight to his house and pierre had put
him up and lent him money pierre recalled how h l ne had smilingly
expressed disapproval of d lokhov s living at their house and how
cynically d lokhov had praised his wife s beauty to him and from that
time till they came to moscow had not left them for a day 

 yes he is very handsome thought pierre and i know him it
would be particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule
me just because i have exerted myself on his behalf befriended him 
and helped him i know and understand what a spice that would add to the
pleasure of deceiving me if it really were true yes if it were true 
but i do not believe it i have no right to and can t believe it 
he remembered the expression d lokhov s face assumed in his moments
of cruelty as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them
into the water or when he challenged a man to a duel without any
reason or shot a post boy s horse with a pistol that expression
was often on d lokhov s face when looking at him yes he is a
bully thought pierre to kill a man means nothing to him it must
seem to him that everyone is afraid of him and that must please him 
he must think that i too am afraid of him and in fact i am afraid of
him he thought and again he felt something terrible and monstrous
rising in his soul d lokhov den sov and rost v were now sitting
opposite pierre and seemed very gay rost v was talking merrily to his
two friends one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious
duelist and rake and every now and then he glanced ironically at
pierre whose preoccupied absent minded and massive figure was a very
noticeable one at the dinner rost v looked inimically at pierre 
first because pierre appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian the
husband of a beauty and in a word an old woman and secondly because
pierre in his preoccupation and absent mindedness had not recognized
rost v and had not responded to his greeting when the emperor s
health was drunk pierre lost in thought did not rise or lift his
glass 

 what are you about shouted rost v looking at him in an ecstasy
of exasperation don t you hear it s his majesty the emperor s
health 

pierre sighed rose submissively emptied his glass and waiting till
all were seated again turned with his kindly smile to rost v 

 why i didn t recognize you he said but rost v was otherwise
engaged he was shouting hurrah 

 why don t you renew the acquaintance said d lokhov to rost v 

 confound him he s a fool said rost v 

 one should make up to the husbands of pretty women said den sov 

pierre did not catch what they were saying but knew they were talking
about him he reddened and turned away 

 well now to the health of handsome women said d lokhov and
with a serious expression but with a smile lurking at the corners of
his mouth he turned with his glass to pierre 

 here s to the health of lovely women peterkin and their
lovers he added 

pierre with downcast eyes drank out of his glass without looking at
d lokhov or answering him the footman who was distributing leaflets
with kut zov s cantata laid one before pierre as one of the
principal guests he was just going to take it when d lokhov leaning
across snatched it from his hand and began reading it pierre looked
at d lokhov and his eyes dropped the something terrible and monstrous
that had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took possession of him 
he leaned his whole massive body across the table 

 how dare you take it he shouted 

hearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed nesv tski and the
neighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to bez khov 

 don t don t what are you about whispered their frightened
voices 

d lokhov looked at pierre with clear mirthful cruel eyes and that
smile of his which seemed to say ah this is what i like 

 you shan t have it he said distinctly 

pale with quivering lips pierre snatched the copy 

 you you scoundrel i challenge you he ejaculated and 
pushing back his chair he rose from the table 

at the very instant he did this and uttered those words pierre felt
that the question of his wife s guilt which had been tormenting him
the whole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative 
he hated her and was forever sundered from her despite den sov s
request that he would take no part in the matter rost v agreed to be
d lokhov s second and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for
the duel with nesv tski bez khov s second pierre went home but
rost v with d lokhov and den sov stayed on at the club till late 
listening to the gypsies and other singers 

 well then till tomorrow at sok lniki said d lokhov as he took
leave of rost v in the club porch 

 and do you feel quite calm rost v asked 

d lokhov paused 

 well you see i ll tell you the whole secret of dueling in two
words if you are going to fight a duel and you make a will and write
affectionate letters to your parents and if you think you may be
killed you are a fool and are lost for certain but go with the firm
intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible and
then all will be right as our bear huntsman at kostrom used to tell
me everyone fears a bear he says but when you see one your
fear s all gone and your only thought is not to let him get away 
and that s how it is with me demain mon cher 

 till tomorrow my dear fellow 

next day at eight in the morning pierre and nesv tski drove to the
sok lniki forest and found d lokhov den sov and rost v already
there pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which
had no connection with the matter in hand his haggard face was yellow 
he had evidently not slept that night he looked about distractedly and
screwed up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun he was entirely absorbed
by two considerations his wife s guilt of which after his sleepless
night he had not the slightest doubt and the guiltlessness of
d lokhov who had no reason to preserve the honor of a man who was
nothing to him i should perhaps have done the same thing in his
place thought pierre it s even certain that i should have done
the same then why this duel this murder either i shall kill him or
he will hit me in the head or elbow or knee can t i go away from
here run away bury myself somewhere passed through his mind but
just at moments when such thoughts occurred to him he would ask in a
particularly calm and absent minded way which inspired the respect of
the onlookers will it be long are things ready 

when all was ready the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriers 
and the pistols loaded nesv tski went up to pierre 

 i should not be doing my duty count he said in timid tones 
 and should not justify your confidence and the honor you have done
me in choosing me for your second if at this grave this very
grave moment i did not tell you the whole truth i think there is no
sufficient ground for this affair or for blood to be shed over it 
you were not right not quite in the right you were impetuous 

 oh yes it is horribly stupid said pierre 

 then allow me to express your regrets and i am sure your opponent
will accept them said nesv tski who like the others concerned in
the affair and like everyone in similar cases did not yet believe that
the affair had come to an actual duel you know count it is much
more honorable to admit one s mistake than to let matters become
irreparable there was no insult on either side allow me to
convey 

 no what is there to talk about said pierre it s all the
same is everything ready he added only tell me where to go
and where to shoot he said with an unnaturally gentle smile 

he took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of the
trigger as he had not before held a pistol in his hand a fact that he
did not wish to confess 

 oh yes like that i know i only forgot said he 

 no apologies none whatever said d lokhov to den sov who on
his side had been attempting a reconciliation and he also went up to
the appointed place 

the spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road 
where the sleighs had been left in a small clearing in the pine forest
covered with melting snow the frost having begun to break up during the
last few days the antagonists stood forty paces apart at the farther
edge of the clearing the seconds measuring the paces left tracks in
the deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing and
nesv tski s and d lokhov s sabers which were stuck into the
ground ten paces apart to mark the barrier it was thawing and misty at
forty paces distance nothing could be seen for three minutes all had
been ready but they still delayed and all were silent 





chapter v

 well begin said d lokhov 

 all right said pierre still smiling in the same way a feeling
of dread was in the air it was evident that the affair so lightly begun
could no longer be averted but was taking its course independently of
men s will 

den sov first went to the barrier and announced as the
adve sawies have wefused a weconciliation please pwoceed take your
pistols and at the word thwee begin to advance 

 o ne t wo thwee he shouted angrily and stepped aside 

the combatants advanced along the trodden tracks nearer and nearer to
one another beginning to see one another through the mist they had the
right to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier d lokhov
walked slowly without raising his pistol looking intently with his
bright sparkling blue eyes into his antagonist s face his mouth wore
its usual semblance of a smile 

 so i can fire when i like said pierre and at the word
 three he went quickly forward missing the trodden path and
stepping into the deep snow he held the pistol in his right hand at
arm s length apparently afraid of shooting himself with it his left
hand he held carefully back because he wished to support his right
hand with it and knew he must not do so having advanced six paces and
strayed off the track into the snow pierre looked down at his feet 
then quickly glanced at d lokhov and bending his finger as he had been
shown fired not at all expecting so loud a report pierre shuddered
at the sound and then smiling at his own sensations stood still the
smoke rendered denser by the mist prevented him from seeing anything
for an instant but there was no second report as he had expected he
only heard d lokhov s hurried steps and his figure came in view
through the smoke he was pressing one hand to his left side while
the other clutched his drooping pistol his face was pale rost v ran
toward him and said something 

 no o o muttered d lokhov through his teeth no it s not
over and after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the
saber he sank on the snow beside it his left hand was bloody he wiped
it on his coat and supported himself with it his frowning face was
pallid and quivered 

 plea began d lokhov but could not at first pronounce the
word 

 please he uttered with an effort 

pierre hardly restraining his sobs began running toward d lokhov and
was about to cross the space between the barriers when d lokhov cried 

 to your barrier and pierre grasping what was meant stopped by
his saber only ten paces divided them d lokhov lowered his head to
the snow greedily bit at it again raised his head adjusted himself 
drew in his legs and sat up seeking a firm center of gravity he sucked
and swallowed the cold snow his lips quivered but his eyes still
smiling glittered with effort and exasperation as he mustered his
remaining strength he raised his pistol and aimed 

 sideways cover yourself with your pistol ejaculated nesv tski 

 cover yourself even den sov cried to his adversary 

pierre with a gentle smile of pity and remorse his arms and legs
helplessly spread out stood with his broad chest directly facing
d lokhov and looked sorrowfully at him den sov rost v and
nesv tski closed their eyes at the same instant they heard a report
and d lokhov s angry cry 

 missed shouted d lokhov and he lay helplessly face downwards
on the snow 

pierre clutched his temples and turning round went into the forest 
trampling through the deep snow and muttering incoherent words 

 folly folly death lies he repeated puckering his face 

nesv tski stopped him and took him home 

rost v and den sov drove away with the wounded d lokhov 

the latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not answer
a word to the questions addressed to him but on entering moscow he
suddenly came to and lifting his head with an effort took rost v who
was sitting beside him by the hand rost v was struck by the
totally altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on
d lokhov s face 

 well how do you feel he asked 

 bad but it s not that my friend said d lokhov with a
gasping voice where are we in moscow i know i don t matter 
but i have killed her killed she won t get over it she won t
survive 

 who asked rost v 

 my mother my mother my angel my adored angel mother and
d lokhov pressed rost v s hand and burst into tears 

when he had become a little quieter he explained to rost v that he was
living with his mother who if she saw him dying would not survive it 
he implored rost v to go on and prepare her 

rost v went on ahead to do what was asked and to his great surprise
learned that d lokhov the brawler d lokhov the bully lived in moscow
with an old mother and a hunchback sister and was the most affectionate
of sons and brothers 





chapter vi

pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone both in petersburg and in
moscow their house was always full of visitors the night after the
duel he did not go to his bedroom but as he often did remained in his
father s room that huge room in which count bez khov had died 

he lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that
had happened to him but could not do so such a storm of feelings 
thoughts and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fall
asleep nor even remain in one place but had to jump up and pace the
room with rapid steps now he seemed to see her in the early days of
their marriage with bare shoulders and a languid passionate look on
her face and then immediately he saw beside her d lokhov s handsome 
insolent hard and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet and
then that same face pale quivering and suffering as it had been when
he reeled and sank on the snow 

 what has happened he asked himself i have killed her lover 
yes killed my wife s lover yes that was it and why how did i come
to do it because you married her answered an inner voice 

 but in what was i to blame he asked in marrying her without
loving her in deceiving yourself and her and he vividly recalled
that moment after supper at prince vas li s when he spoke those
words he had found so difficult to utter i love you it all
comes from that even then i felt it he thought i felt then that
it was not so that i had no right to do it and so it turns out 

he remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection 
particularly vivid humiliating and shameful was the recollection of
how one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into his
study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his head
steward there who bowing respectfully looked into his face and at
his dressing gown and smiled slightly as if expressing respectful
understanding of his employer s happiness 

 but how often i have felt proud of her proud of her majestic beauty
and social tact thought he been proud of my house in which she
received all petersburg proud of her unapproachability and beauty so
this is what i was proud of i then thought that i did not understand
her how often when considering her character i have told myself that
i was to blame for not understanding her for not understanding that
constant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desires 
and the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depraved
woman now i have spoken that terrible word to myself all has become
clear 

 anatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her
naked shoulders she did not give him the money but let herself be
kissed her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy and she replied
with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous let
him do what he pleases she used to say of me one day i asked her if
she felt any symptoms of pregnancy she laughed contemptuously and said
she was not a fool to want to have children and that she was not going
to have any children by me 

then he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the
vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her though she had
been brought up in the most aristocratic circles 

 i m not such a fool just you try it on allez vous
promener she used to say often seeing the success she had with
young and old men and women pierre could not understand why he did not
love her 

 you clear out of this 


 yes i never loved her said he to himself i knew she was a
depraved woman he repeated but dared not admit it to myself 
and now there s d lokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and
perhaps dying while meeting my remorse with some forced bravado 

pierre was one of those people who in spite of an appearance of what
is called weak character do not seek a confidant in their troubles he
digested his sufferings alone 

 it is all all her fault he said to himself but what of that 
why did i bind myself to her why did i say je vous aime to her 
which was a lie and worse than a lie i am guilty and must endure 
what a slur on my name a misfortune for life oh that s
nonsense he thought the slur on my name and honor that s all
apart from myself 

 i love you 

 louis xvi was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a
criminal came into pierre s head and from their point of
view they were right as were those too who canonized him and died a
martyr s death for his sake then robespierre was beheaded for being
a despot who is right and who is wrong no one but if you are
alive live tomorrow you ll die as i might have died an hour ago 
and is it worth tormenting oneself when one has only a moment of life
in comparison with eternity 

but at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflections 
she suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments when he had
most strongly expressed his insincere love for her and he felt the
blood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move about and break
and tear whatever came to his hand why did i tell her that je
vous aime he kept repeating to himself and when he had said it
for the tenth time moli re s words mais que diable allait il
faire dans cette gal re occurred to him and he began to laugh at
himself 

 but what the devil was he doing in that galley 


in the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to
petersburg he could not imagine how he could speak to her now he
resolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his
intention to part from her forever 

next morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee pierre
was lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand 

he woke up and looked round for a while with a startled expression 
unable to realize where he was 

 the countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at
home said the valet 

but before pierre could decide what answer he would send the countess
herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and with
simply dressed hair two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like
a coronet entered the room calm and majestic except that there was
a wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow with her
imperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in front of the valet 
she knew of the duel and had come to speak about it she waited till the
valet had set down the coffee things and left the room pierre looked
at her timidly over his spectacles and like a hare surrounded by hounds
who lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her
enemies he tried to continue reading but feeling this to be senseless
and impossible he again glanced timidly at her she did not sit down
but looked at him with a contemptuous smile waiting for the valet to
go 

 well what s this now what have you been up to now i should like
to know she asked sternly 

 i what have i stammered pierre 

 so it seems you re a hero eh come now what was this duel about 
what is it meant to prove what i ask you 

pierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth but
could not reply 

 if you won t answer i ll tell you h l ne went on you
believe everything you re told you were told h l ne laughed 
 that d lokhov was my lover she said in french with her coarse
plainness of speech uttering the word amant as casually as any other
word and you believed it well what have you proved what does this
duel prove that you re a fool que vous tes un sot but everybody
knew that what will be the result that i shall be the laughingstock of
all moscow that everyone will say that you drunk and not knowing what
you were about challenged a man you are jealous of without cause 
h l ne raised her voice and became more and more excited a man
who s a better man than you in every way 

 hm hm growled pierre frowning without looking at her and
not moving a muscle 

 and how could you believe he was my lover why because i like
his company if you were cleverer and more agreeable i should prefer
yours 

 don t speak to me i beg you muttered pierre hoarsely 

 why shouldn t i speak i can speak as i like and i tell you
plainly that there are not many wives with husbands such as you who
would not have taken lovers des amants but i have not done so 
said she 

pierre wished to say something looked at her with eyes whose strange
expression she did not understand and lay down again he was suffering
physically at that moment there was a weight on his chest and he could
not breathe he knew that he must do something to put an end to this
suffering but what he wanted to do was too terrible 

 we had better separate he muttered in a broken voice 

 separate very well but only if you give me a fortune said
h l ne separate that s a thing to frighten me with 

pierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward her 

 i ll kill you he shouted and seizing the marble top of a table
with a strength he had never before felt he made a step toward her
brandishing the slab 

h l ne s face became terrible she shrieked and sprang aside his
father s nature showed itself in pierre he felt the fascination and
delight of frenzy he flung down the slab broke it and swooping
down on her with outstretched hands shouted get out in such a
terrible voice that the whole house heard it with horror god knows what
he would have done at that moment had h l ne not fled from the room 


a week later pierre gave his wife full power to control all his estates
in great russia which formed the larger part of his property and left
for petersburg alone 





chapter vii

two months had elapsed since the news of the battle of austerlitz and
the loss of prince andrew had reached bald hills and in spite of the
letters sent through the embassy and all the searches made his body had
not been found nor was he on the list of prisoners what was worst of
all for his relations was the fact that there was still a possibility of
his having been picked up on the battlefield by the people of the
place and that he might now be lying recovering or dying alone among
strangers and unable to send news of himself the gazettes from which
the old prince first heard of the defeat at austerlitz stated as usual
very briefly and vaguely that after brilliant engagements the russians
had had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order the
old prince understood from this official report that our army had been
defeated a week after the gazette report of the battle of austerlitz
came a letter from kut zov informing the prince of the fate that had
befallen his son 

 your son wrote kut zov fell before my eyes a standard in
his hand and at the head of a regiment he fell as a hero worthy of
his father and his fatherland to the great regret of myself and of the
whole army it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not i comfort
myself and you with the hope that your son is alive for otherwise
he would have been mentioned among the officers found on the field of
battle a list of whom has been sent me under flag of truce 

after receiving this news late in the evening when he was alone in his
study the old prince went for his walk as usual next morning but he
was silent with his steward the gardener and the architect and though
he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone 

when princess mary went to him at the usual hour he was working at his
lathe and as usual did not look round at her 

 ah princess mary he said suddenly in an unnatural voice 
throwing down his chisel the wheel continued to revolve by its own
impetus and princess mary long remembered the dying creak of that
wheel which merged in her memory with what followed 

she approached him saw his face and something gave way within her her
eyes grew dim by the expression of her father s face not sad not
crushed but angry and working unnaturally she saw that hanging over
her and about to crush her was some terrible misfortune the worst
in life one she had not yet experienced irreparable and
incomprehensible the death of one she loved 

 father andrew said the ungraceful awkward princess with such
an indescribable charm of sorrow and self forgetfulness that her father
could not bear her look but turned away with a sob 

 bad news he s not among the prisoners nor among the killed 
kut zov writes and he screamed as piercingly as if he wished to
drive the princess away by that scream killed 

the princess did not fall down or faint she was already pale but on
hearing these words her face changed and something brightened in her
beautiful radiant eyes it was as if joy a supreme joy apart from the
joys and sorrows of this world overflowed the great grief within her 
she forgot all fear of her father went up to him took his hand and
drawing him down put her arm round his thin scraggy neck 

 father she said do not turn away from me let us weep
together 

 scoundrels blackguards shrieked the old man turning his face
away from her destroying the army destroying the men and why go 
go and tell lise 

the princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father and
wept she saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he took
leave of her and of lise his look tender yet proud she saw him tender
and amused as he was when he put on the little icon did he believe 
had he repented of his unbelief was he now there there in the realms
of eternal peace and blessedness she thought 

 father tell me how it happened she asked through her tears 

 go go killed in battle where the best of russian men and
russia s glory were led to destruction go princess mary go and tell
lise i will follow 

when princess mary returned from her father the little princess sat
working and looked up with that curious expression of inner happy calm
peculiar to pregnant women it was evident that her eyes did not see
princess mary but were looking within into herself at something
joyful and mysterious taking place within her 

 mary she said moving away from the embroidery frame and lying
back give me your hand she took her sister in law s hand and
held it below her waist 

her eyes were smiling expectantly her downy lip rose and remained
lifted in childlike happiness 

princess mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of her
sister in law s dress 

 there there do you feel it i feel so strange and do you know 
mary i am going to love him very much said lise looking with
bright and happy eyes at her sister in law 

princess mary could not lift her head she was weeping 

 what is the matter mary 

 nothing only i feel sad sad about andrew she said wiping
away her tears on her sister in law s knee 

several times in the course of the morning princess mary began trying to
prepare her sister in law and every time began to cry unobservant as
was the little princess these tears the cause of which she did not
understand agitated her she said nothing but looked about uneasily as
if in search of something before dinner the old prince of whom she was
always afraid came into her room with a peculiarly restless and malign
expression and went out again without saying a word she looked at
princess mary then sat thinking for a while with that expression of
attention to something within her that is only seen in pregnant women 
and suddenly began to cry 

 has anything come from andrew she asked 

 no you know it s too soon for news but my father is anxious and i
feel afraid 

 so there s nothing 

 nothing answered princess mary looking firmly with her radiant
eyes at her sister in law 

she had determined not to tell her and persuaded her father to hide the
terrible news from her till after her confinement which was expected
within a few days princess mary and the old prince each bore and hid
their grief in their own way the old prince would not cherish any hope 
he made up his mind that prince andrew had been killed and though he
sent an official to austria to seek for traces of his son he ordered a
monument from moscow which he intended to erect in his own garden to his
memory and he told everybody that his son had been killed he tried not
to change his former way of life but his strength failed him he walked
less ate less slept less and became weaker every day princess mary
hoped she prayed for her brother as living and was always awaiting news
of his return 





chapter viii

 dearest said the little princess after breakfast on the morning
of the nineteenth march and her downy little lip rose from old habit 
but as sorrow was manifest in every smile the sound of every word and
even every footstep in that house since the terrible news had come so
now the smile of the little princess influenced by the general mood
though without knowing its cause was such as to remind one still more
of the general sorrow 

 dearest i m afraid this morning s fruschtique as f ka the
cook calls it has disagreed with me 

 fr hst ck breakfast 

 what is the matter with you my darling you look pale oh you
are very pale said princess mary in alarm running with her soft 
ponderous steps up to her sister in law 

 your excellency should not mary bogd novna be sent for said one
of the maids who was present mary bogd novna was a midwife from the
neighboring town who had been at bald hills for the last fortnight 

 oh yes assented princess mary perhaps that s it i ll go 
courage my angel she kissed lise and was about to leave the room 

 oh no no and besides the pallor and the physical suffering
on the little princess face an expression of childish fear of
inevitable pain showed itself 

 no it s only indigestion say it s only indigestion say so 
mary say and the little princess began to cry capriciously like
a suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some
affectation princess mary ran out of the room to fetch mary
bogd novna 

 mon dieu mon dieu oh she heard as she left the room 

the midwife was already on her way to meet her rubbing her small plump
white hands with an air of calm importance 

 mary bogd novna i think it s beginning said princess mary
looking at the midwife with wide open eyes of alarm 

 well the lord be thanked princess said mary bogd novna not
hastening her steps you young ladies should not know anything about
it 

 but how is it the doctor from moscow is not here yet said the
princess in accordance with lise s and prince andrew s wishes they
had sent in good time to moscow for a doctor and were expecting him at
any moment 

 no matter princess don t be alarmed said mary bogd novna 
 we ll manage very well without a doctor 

five minutes later princess mary from her room heard something heavy
being carried by she looked out the men servants were carrying the
large leather sofa from prince andrew s study into the bedroom on
their faces was a quiet and solemn look 

princess mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the
house now and then opening her door when someone passed and watching
what was going on in the passage some women passing with quiet steps in
and out of the bedroom glanced at the princess and turned away she did
not venture to ask any questions and shut the door again now sitting
down in her easy chair now taking her prayer book now kneeling before
the icon stand to her surprise and distress she found that her prayers
did not calm her excitement suddenly her door opened softly and her old
nurse prask vya s vishna who hardly ever came to that room as the
old prince had forbidden it appeared on the threshold with a shawl
round her head 

 i ve come to sit with you a bit m sha said the nurse and
here i ve brought the prince s wedding candles to light before his
saint my angel she said with a sigh 

 oh nurse i m so glad 

 god is merciful birdie 

the nurse lit the gilt candles before the icons and sat down by the door
with her knitting princess mary took a book and began reading only
when footsteps or voices were heard did they look at one another the
princess anxious and inquiring the nurse encouraging everyone in the
house was dominated by the same feeling that princess mary experienced
as she sat in her room but owing to the superstition that the fewer
the people who know of it the less a woman in travail suffers everyone
tried to pretend not to know no one spoke of it but apart from the
ordinary staid and respectful good manners habitual in the prince s
household a common anxiety a softening of the heart and a
consciousness that something great and mysterious was being accomplished
at that moment made itself felt 

there was no laughter in the maids large hall in the men servants 
hall all sat waiting silently and alert in the outlying serfs 
quarters torches and candles were burning and no one slept the old
prince stepping on his heels paced up and down his study and sent
t khon to ask mary bogd novna what news say only that the
prince told me to ask and come and tell me her answer 

 inform the prince that labor has begun said mary bogd novna 
giving the messenger a significant look 

t khon went and told the prince 

 very good said the prince closing the door behind him and
t khon did not hear the slightest sound from the study after that 

after a while he re entered it as if to snuff the candles and seeing
the prince was lying on the sofa looked at him noticed his perturbed
face shook his head and going up to him silently kissed him on the
shoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles or saying why he
had entered the most solemn mystery in the world continued its course 
evening passed night came and the feeling of suspense and softening of
heart in the presence of the unfathomable did not lessen but increased 
no one slept 

it was one of those march nights when winter seems to wish to resume its
sway and scatters its last snows and storms with desperate fury a relay
of horses had been sent up the highroad to meet the german doctor from
moscow who was expected every moment and men on horseback with lanterns
were sent to the crossroads to guide him over the country road with its
hollows and snow covered pools of water 

princess mary had long since put aside her book she sat silent her
luminous eyes fixed on her nurse s wrinkled face every line of which
she knew so well on the lock of gray hair that escaped from under the
kerchief and the loose skin that hung under her chin 

nurse s vishna knitting in hand was telling in low tones scarcely
hearing or understanding her own words what she had told hundreds of
times before how the late princess had given birth to princess mary
in kishen v with only a moldavian peasant woman to help instead of a
midwife 

 god is merciful doctors are never needed she said 

suddenly a gust of wind beat violently against the casement of the
window from which the double frame had been removed by order of the
prince one window frame was removed in each room as soon as the larks
returned and forcing open a loosely closed latch set the damask
curtain flapping and blew out the candle with its chill snowy draft 
princess mary shuddered her nurse putting down the stocking she was
knitting went to the window and leaning out tried to catch the open
casement the cold wind flapped the ends of her kerchief and her loose
locks of gray hair 

 princess my dear there s someone driving up the avenue she
said holding the casement and not closing it with lanterns most
likely the doctor 

 oh my god thank god said princess mary i must go and meet
him he does not know russian 

princess mary threw a shawl over her head and ran to meet the newcomer 
as she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the window a carriage
with lanterns standing at the entrance she went out on the stairs on
a banister post stood a tallow candle which guttered in the draft on
the landing below philip the footman stood looking scared and holding
another candle still lower beyond the turn of the staircase one
could hear the footstep of someone in thick felt boots and a voice that
seemed familiar to princess mary was saying something 

 thank god said the voice and father 

 gone to bed replied the voice of demy n the house steward who
was downstairs 

then the voice said something more demy n replied and the steps in
the felt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase more rapidly 

 it s andrew thought princess mary no it can t be that
would be too extraordinary and at the very moment she thought this 
the face and figure of prince andrew in a fur cloak the deep collar of
which covered with snow appeared on the landing where the footman
stood with the candle yes it was he pale thin with a changed and
strangely softened but agitated expression on his face he came up the
stairs and embraced his sister 

 you did not get my letter he asked and not waiting for a
reply which he would not have received for the princess was unable to
speak he turned back rapidly mounted the stairs again with the
doctor who had entered the hall after him they had met at the last post
station and again embraced his sister 

 what a strange fate m sha darling and having taken off his
cloak and felt boots he went to the little princess apartment 





chapter ix

the little princess lay supported by pillows with a white cap on her
head the pains had just left her strands of her black hair lay round
her inflamed and perspiring cheeks her charming rosy mouth with its
downy lip was open and she was smiling joyfully prince andrew entered
and paused facing her at the foot of the sofa on which she was lying 
her glittering eyes filled with childlike fear and excitement rested
on him without changing their expression i love you all and have
done no harm to anyone why must i suffer so help me her look
seemed to say she saw her husband but did not realize the significance
of his appearance before her now prince andrew went round the sofa and
kissed her forehead 

 my darling he said a word he had never used to her before 
 god is merciful 

she looked at him inquiringly and with childlike reproach 

 i expected help from you and i get none none from you either 
said her eyes she was not surprised at his having come she did
not realize that he had come his coming had nothing to do with
her sufferings or with their relief the pangs began again and mary
bogd novna advised prince andrew to leave the room 

the doctor entered prince andrew went out and meeting princess mary 
again joined her they began talking in whispers but their talk broke
off at every moment they waited and listened 

 go dear said princess mary 

prince andrew went again to his wife and sat waiting in the room next
to hers a woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face and became
confused when she saw prince andrew he covered his face with his hands
and remained so for some minutes piteous helpless animal moans came
through the door prince andrew got up went to the door and tried to
open it someone was holding it shut 

 you can t come in you can t said a terrified voice from
within 

he began pacing the room the screaming ceased and a few more seconds
went by then suddenly a terrible shriek it could not be hers she
could not scream like that came from the bedroom prince andrew ran to
the door the scream ceased and he heard the wail of an infant 

 what have they taken a baby in there for thought prince andrew in
the first second a baby what baby why is there a baby there or
is the baby born 

then suddenly he realized the joyful significance of that wail tears
choked him and leaning his elbows on the window sill he began to cry 
sobbing like a child the door opened the doctor with his shirt sleeves
tucked up without a coat pale and with a trembling jaw came out
of the room prince andrew turned to him but the doctor gave him a
bewildered look and passed by without a word a woman rushed out and
seeing prince andrew stopped hesitating on the threshold he went into
his wife s room she was lying dead in the same position he had seen
her in five minutes before and despite the fixed eyes and the pallor of
the cheeks the same expression was on her charming childlike face with
its upper lip covered with tiny black hair 

 i love you all and have done no harm to anyone and what have you
done to me said her charming pathetic dead face 

in a corner of the room something red and tiny gave a grunt and squealed
in mary bogd novna s trembling white hands 


two hours later prince andrew stepping softly went into his father s
room the old man already knew everything he was standing close to
the door and as soon as it opened his rough old arms closed like a vise
round his son s neck and without a word he began to sob like a child 


three days later the little princess was buried and prince andrew went
up the steps to where the coffin stood to give her the farewell kiss 
and there in the coffin was the same face though with closed eyes 
 ah what have you done to me it still seemed to say and prince
andrew felt that something gave way in his soul and that he was guilty
of a sin he could neither remedy nor forget he could not weep the
old man too came up and kissed the waxen little hands that lay quietly
crossed one on the other on her breast and to him too her face seemed
to say ah what have you done to me and why and at the sight
the old man turned angrily away 


another five days passed and then the young prince nicholas andr evich
was baptized the wet nurse supported the coverlet with her chin while
the priest with a goose feather anointed the boy s little red and
wrinkled soles and palms 

his grandfather who was his godfather trembling and afraid of dropping
him carried the infant round the battered tin font and handed him over
to the godmother princess mary prince andrew sat in another room 
faint with fear lest the baby should be drowned in the font and awaited
the termination of the ceremony he looked up joyfully at the baby when
the nurse brought it to him and nodded approval when she told him that
the wax with the baby s hair had not sunk in the font but had floated 





chapter x

rost v s share in d lokhov s duel with bez khov was hushed up by
the efforts of the old count and instead of being degraded to the ranks
as he expected he was appointed an adjutant to the governor general of
moscow as a result he could not go to the country with the rest of the
family but was kept all summer in moscow by his new duties d lokhov
recovered and rost v became very friendly with him during his
convalescence d lokhov lay ill at his mother s who loved him
passionately and tenderly and old mary iv novna who had grown fond of
rost v for his friendship to her f dya often talked to him about her
son 

 yes count she would say he is too noble and pure souled for
our present depraved world no one now loves virtue it seems like
a reproach to everyone now tell me count was it right was it
honorable of bez khov and f dya with his noble spirit loved him
and even now never says a word against him those pranks in petersburg
when they played some tricks on a policeman didn t they do it
together and there bez khov got off scotfree while f dya had to
bear the whole burden on his shoulders fancy what he had to go through 
it s true he has been reinstated but how could they fail to do that 
i think there were not many such gallant sons of the fatherland out
there as he and now this duel have these people no feeling or
honor knowing him to be an only son to challenge him and shoot so
straight it s well god had mercy on us and what was it for who
doesn t have intrigues nowadays why if he was so jealous as i see
things he should have shown it sooner but he lets it go on for months 
and then to call him out reckoning on f dya not fighting because he
owed him money what baseness what meanness i know you understand
f dya my dear count that believe me is why i am so fond of you few
people do understand him he is such a lofty heavenly soul 

d lokhov himself during his convalescence spoke to rost v in a way no
one would have expected of him 

 i know people consider me a bad man he said let them i
don t care a straw about anyone but those i love but those i love 
i love so that i would give my life for them and the others i d
throttle if they stood in my way i have an adored a priceless mother 
and two or three friends you among them and as for the rest i only
care about them in so far as they are harmful or useful and most of
them are harmful especially the women yes dear boy he continued 
 i have met loving noble high minded men but i have not yet met
any women countesses or cooks who were not venal i have not yet met
that divine purity and devotion i look for in women if i found such a
one i d give my life for her but those and he made a gesture
of contempt and believe me if i still value my life it is
only because i still hope to meet such a divine creature who will
regenerate purify and elevate me but you don t understand it 

 oh yes i quite understand answered rost v who was under his
new friend s influence 

in the autumn the rost vs returned to moscow early in the winter
den sov also came back and stayed with them the first half of the
winter of 1806 which nicholas rost v spent in moscow was one of the
happiest merriest times for him and the whole family nicholas brought
many young men to his parents house v ra was a handsome girl
of twenty s nya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an opening
flower nat sha half grown up and half child was now childishly
amusing now girlishly enchanting 

at that time in the rost vs house there prevailed an amorous
atmosphere characteristic of homes where there are very young and very
charming girls every young man who came to the house seeing those
impressionable smiling young faces smiling probably at their own
happiness feeling the eager bustle around him and hearing the fitful
bursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle of
young girls ready for anything and full of hope experienced the same
feeling sharing with the young folk of the rost vs household a
readiness to fall in love and an expectation of happiness 

among the young men introduced by rost v one of the first was
d lokhov whom everyone in the house liked except nat sha she almost
quarreled with her brother about him she insisted that he was a bad
man and that in the duel with bez khov pierre was right and d lokhov
wrong and further that he was disagreeable and unnatural 

 there s nothing for me to understand she cried out with
resolute self will he is wicked and heartless there now i like
your den sov though he is a rake and all that still i like him so
you see i do understand i don t know how to put it with this one
everything is calculated and i don t like that but den sov 

 oh den sov is quite different replied nicholas implying that
even den sov was nothing compared to d lokhov you must understand
what a soul there is in d lokhov you should see him with his mother 
what a heart 

 well i don t know about that but i am uncomfortable with him and
do you know he has fallen in love with s nya 

 what nonsense 

 i m certain of it you ll see 

nat sha s prediction proved true d lokhov who did not usually care
for the society of ladies began to come often to the house and the
question for whose sake he came though no one spoke of it was soon
settled he came because of s nya and s nya though she would never
have dared to say so knew it and blushed scarlet every time d lokhov
appeared 

d lokhov often dined at the rost vs never missed a performance at
which they were present and went to iogel s balls for young people
which the rost vs always attended he was pointedly attentive to s nya
and looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear his
glances without coloring but even the old countess and nat sha blushed
when they saw his looks 

it was evident that this strange strong man was under the irresistible
influence of the dark graceful girl who loved another 

rost v noticed something new in d lokhov s relations with s nya 
but he did not explain to himself what these new relations were 
 they re always in love with someone he thought of s nya and
nat sha but he was not as much at ease with s nya and d lokhov as
before and was less frequently at home 

in the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of the war with
napoleon with even greater warmth than the year before orders were
given to raise recruits ten men in every thousand for the regular army 
and besides this nine men in every thousand for the militia everywhere
bonaparte was anathematized and in moscow nothing but the coming war
was talked of for the rost v family the whole interest of these
preparations for war lay in the fact that nicholas would not hear of
remaining in moscow and only awaited the termination of den sov s
furlough after christmas to return with him to their regiment his
approaching departure did not prevent his amusing himself but rather
gave zest to his pleasures he spent the greater part of his time away
from home at dinners parties and balls 





chapter xi

on the third day after christmas nicholas dined at home a thing he had
rarely done of late it was a grand farewell dinner as he and den sov
were leaving to join their regiment after epiphany about twenty people
were present including d lokhov and den sov 

never had love been so much in the air and never had the amorous
atmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the rost vs house as at
this holiday time seize the moments of happiness love and be loved 
that is the only reality in the world all else is folly it is the one
thing we are interested in here said the spirit of the place 

nicholas having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses without
visiting all the places he meant to go to and where he had been invited 
returned home just before dinner as soon as he entered he noticed and
felt the tension of the amorous air in the house and also noticed a
curious embarrassment among some of those present s nya d lokhov 
and the old countess were especially disturbed and to a lesser degree
nat sha nicholas understood that something must have happened between
s nya and d lokhov before dinner and with the kindly sensitiveness
natural to him was very gentle and wary with them both at dinner on
that same evening there was to be one of the balls that iogel the
dancing master gave for his pupils during the holidays 

 nicholas will you come to iogel s please do said nat sha 
 he asked you and vas li dm trich is also going 

 den sov 

 where would i not go at the countess command said den sov 
who at the rost vs had jocularly assumed the role of nat sha s
knight i m even weady to dance the pas de ch le 

 if i have time answered nicholas but i promised the
arkh rovs they have a party 

 and you he asked d lokhov but as soon as he had asked the
question he noticed that it should not have been put 

 perhaps coldly and angrily replied d lokhov glancing at s nya 
and scowling he gave nicholas just such a look as he had given pierre
at the club dinner 

 there is something up thought nicholas and he was further
confirmed in this conclusion by the fact that d lokhov left immediately
after dinner he called nat sha and asked her what was the matter 

 and i was looking for you said nat sha running out to him i
told you but you would not believe it she said triumphantly he
has proposed to s nya 

little as nicholas had occupied himself with s nya of late something
seemed to give way within him at this news d lokhov was a suitable and
in some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless orphan girl from
the point of view of the old countess and of society it was out of the
question for her to refuse him and therefore nicholas first feeling
on hearing the news was one of anger with s nya he tried to say 
 that s capital of course she ll forget her childish promises
and accept the offer but before he had time to say it nat sha began
again 

 and fancy she refused him quite definitely adding after a
pause she told him she loved another 

 yes my s nya could not have done otherwise thought nicholas 

 much as mamma pressed her she refused and i know she won t change
once she has said 

 and mamma pressed her said nicholas reproachfully 

 yes said nat sha do you know nicholas don t be
angry but i know you will not marry her i know heaven knows how but
i know for certain that you won t marry her 

 now you don t know that at all said nicholas but i must
talk to her what a darling s nya is he added with a smile 

 ah she is indeed a darling i ll send her to you 

and nat sha kissed her brother and ran away 

a minute later s nya came in with a frightened guilty and scared
look nicholas went up to her and kissed her hand this was the first
time since his return that they had talked alone and about their love 

 sophie he began timidly at first and then more and more
boldly if you wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and
advantageous match but a splendid noble fellow he is my friend 

s nya interrupted him 

 i have already refused she said hurriedly 

 if you are refusing for my sake i am afraid that i 

s nya again interrupted she gave him an imploring frightened look 

 nicholas don t tell me that she said 

 no but i must it may be arrogant of me but still it is best to say
it if you refuse him on my account i must tell you the whole truth i
love you and i think i love you more than anyone else 

 that is enough for me said s nya blushing 

 no but i have been in love a thousand times and shall fall in
love again though for no one have i such a feeling of friendship 
confidence and love as i have for you then i am young mamma does
not wish it in a word i make no promise and i beg you to consider
d lokhov s offer he said articulating his friend s name with
difficulty 

 don t say that to me i want nothing i love you as a brother and
always shall and i want nothing more 

 you are an angel i am not worthy of you but i am afraid of
misleading you 

and nicholas again kissed her hand 





chapter xii

iogel s were the most enjoyable balls in moscow so said the mothers
as they watched their young people executing their newly learned steps 
and so said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced till they
were ready to drop and so said the grown up young men and women who
came to these balls with an air of condescension and found them most
enjoyable that year two marriages had come of these balls the two
pretty young princesses gorchak v met suitors there and were married
and so further increased the fame of these dances what distinguished
them from others was the absence of host or hostess and the presence of
the good natured iogel flying about like a feather and bowing according
to the rules of his art as he collected the tickets from all his
visitors there was the fact that only those came who wished to dance
and amuse themselves as girls of thirteen and fourteen do who are
wearing long dresses for the first time with scarcely any exceptions
they all were or seemed to be pretty so rapturous were their smiles
and so sparkling their eyes sometimes the best of the pupils of whom
nat sha who was exceptionally graceful was first even danced the pas
de ch le but at this last ball only the cossaise the anglaise and
the mazurka which was just coming into fashion were danced iogel had
taken a ballroom in bez khov s house and the ball as everyone said 
was a great success there were many pretty girls and the rost v girls
were among the prettiest they were both particularly happy and gay 
that evening proud of d lokhov s proposal her refusal and her
explanation with nicholas s nya twirled about before she left home
so that the maid could hardly get her hair plaited and she was
transparently radiant with impulsive joy 

nat sha no less proud of her first long dress and of being at a real
ball was even happier they were both dressed in white muslin with pink
ribbons 

nat sha fell in love the very moment she entered the ballroom she
was not in love with anyone in particular but with everyone whatever
person she happened to look at she was in love with for that moment 

 oh how delightful it is she kept saying running up to s nya 

nicholas and den sov were walking up and down looking with kindly
patronage at the dancers 

 how sweet she is she will be a weal beauty said den sov 

 who 

 countess nat sha answered den sov 

 and how she dances what gwace he said again after a pause 

 who are you talking about 

 about your sister ejaculated den sov testily 

rost v smiled 

 my dear count you were one of my best pupils you must dance 
said little iogel coming up to nicholas look how many charming young
ladies he turned with the same request to den sov who was also a
former pupil of his 

 no my dear fellow i ll be a wallflower said den sov 
 don t you wecollect what bad use i made of your lessons 

 oh no said iogel hastening to reassure him you were only
inattentive but you had talent oh yes you had talent 

the band struck up the newly introduced mazurka nicholas could not
refuse iogel and asked s nya to dance den sov sat down by the old
ladies and leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot told
them something funny and kept them amused while he watched the young
people dancing iogel with nat sha his pride and his best pupil were
the first couple noiselessly skillfully stepping with his little
feet in low shoes iogel flew first across the hall with nat sha who 
though shy went on carefully executing her steps den sov did not
take his eyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearly
indicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and not
because he could not in the middle of a figure he beckoned to rost v
who was passing 

 this is not at all the thing he said what sort of polish
mazuwka is this but she does dance splendidly 

knowing that den sov had a reputation even in poland for the masterly
way in which he danced the mazurka nicholas ran up to nat sha 

 go and choose den sov he is a real dancer a wonder he said 

when it came to nat sha s turn to choose a partner she rose and 
tripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows ran
timidly to the corner where den sov sat she saw that everybody was
looking at her and waiting nicholas saw that den sov was refusing
though he smiled delightedly he ran up to them 

 please vas li dm trich nat sha was saying do come 

 oh no let me off countess den sov replied 

 now then v ska said nicholas 

 they coax me as if i were v ska the cat said den sov jokingly 

 i ll sing for you a whole evening said nat sha 

 oh the faiwy she can do anything with me said den sov and
he unhooked his saber he came out from behind the chairs clasped his
partner s hand firmly threw back his head and advanced his foot 
waiting for the beat only on horse back and in the mazurka was
den sov s short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow
he felt himself to be at the right beat of the music he looked sideways
at his partner with a merry and triumphant air suddenly stamped with
one foot bounded from the floor like a ball and flew round the room
taking his partner with him he glided silently on one foot half across
the room and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight at
them when suddenly clinking his spurs and spreading out his legs 
he stopped short on his heels stood so a second stamped on the spot
clanking his spurs whirled rapidly round and striking his left heel
against his right flew round again in a circle nat sha guessed what
he meant to do and abandoning herself to him followed his lead hardly
knowing how first he spun her round holding her now with his left now
with his right hand then falling on one knee he twirled her round him 
and again jumping up dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if
he would rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath 
and then he suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected
steps when at last smartly whirling his partner round in front of her
chair he drew up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her nat sha
did not even make him a curtsy she fixed her eyes on him in amazement 
smiling as if she did not recognize him 

 what does this mean she brought out 

although iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka everyone
was delighted with den sov s skill he was asked again and again as
a partner and the old men began smilingly to talk about poland and the
good old days den sov flushed after the mazurka and mopping himself
with his handkerchief sat down by nat sha and did not leave her for
the rest of the evening 





chapter xiii

for two days after that rost v did not see d lokhov at his own or at
d lokhov s home on the third day he received a note from him 

as i do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know
of and am going to rejoin my regiment i am giving a farewell supper
tonight to my friends come to the english hotel 

about ten o clock rost v went to the english hotel straight from the
theater where he had been with his family and den sov he was at once
shown to the best room which d lokhov had taken for that evening some
twenty men were gathered round a table at which d lokhov sat between
two candles on the table was a pile of gold and paper money and he
was keeping the bank rost v had not seen him since his proposal and
s nya s refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how they
would meet 

d lokhov s clear cold glance met rost v as soon as he entered the
door as though he had long expected him 

 it s a long time since we met he said thanks for coming 
i ll just finish dealing and then ily shka will come with his
chorus 

 i called once or twice at your house said rost v reddening 

d lokhov made no reply 

 you may punt he said 

rost v recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once had
with d lokhov none but fools trust to luck in play d lokhov
had then said 

 or are you afraid to play with me d lokhov now asked as if
guessing rost v s thought 

beneath his smile rost v saw in him the mood he had shown at the club
dinner and at other times when as if tired of everyday life he had felt
a need to escape from it by some strange and usually cruel action 

rost v felt ill at ease he tried but failed to find some joke with
which to reply to d lokhov s words but before he had thought of
anything d lokhov looking straight in his face said slowly and
deliberately so that everyone could hear 

 do you remember we had a talk about cards he s a fool who
trusts to luck one should make certain and i want to try 

 to try his luck or the certainty rost v asked himself 

 well you d better not play d lokhov added and springing a
new pack of cards said bank gentlemen 

moving the money forward he prepared to deal rost v sat down by his
side and at first did not play d lokhov kept glancing at him 

 why don t you play he asked 

and strange to say nicholas felt that he could not help taking up a
card putting a small stake on it and beginning to play 

 i have no money with me he said 

 i ll trust you 

rost v staked five rubles on a card and lost staked again and again
lost d lokhov killed that is beat ten cards of rost v s
running 

 gentlemen said d lokhov after he had dealt for some time 
 please place your money on the cards or i may get muddled in the
reckoning 

one of the players said he hoped he might be trusted 

 yes you might but i am afraid of getting the accounts mixed so i
ask you to put the money on your cards replied d lokhov don t
stint yourself we ll settle afterwards he added turning to
rost v 

the game continued a waiter kept handing round champagne 

all rost v s cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles scored
up against him he wrote 800 rubles on a card but while the
waiter filled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to his usual
stake of twenty rubles 

 leave it said d lokhov though he did not seem to be even
looking at rost v you ll win it back all the sooner i lose to
the others but win from you or are you afraid of me he asked again 

rost v submitted he let the eight hundred remain and laid down a seven
of hearts with a torn corner which he had picked up from the floor he
well remembered that seven afterwards he laid down the seven of hearts 
on which with a broken bit of chalk he had written 800 rubles in
clear upright figures he emptied the glass of warm champagne that was
handed him smiled at d lokhov s words and with a sinking heart 
waiting for a seven to turn up gazed at d lokhov s hands which held
the pack much depended on rost v s winning or losing on that seven
of hearts on the previous sunday the old count had given his son
two thousand rubles and though he always disliked speaking of money
difficulties had told nicholas that this was all he could let him have
till may and asked him to be more economical this time nicholas had
replied that it would be more than enough for him and that he gave his
word of honor not to take anything more till the spring now only twelve
hundred rubles was left of that money so that this seven of hearts
meant for him not only the loss of sixteen hundred rubles but the
necessity of going back on his word with a sinking heart he watched
d lokhov s hands and thought now then make haste and let me have
this card and i ll take my cap and drive home to supper with den sov 
nat sha and s nya and will certainly never touch a card again at
that moment his home life jokes with p tya talks with s nya duets
with nat sha piquet with his father and even his comfortable bed
in the house on the povarsk ya rose before him with such vividness 
clearness and charm that it seemed as if it were all a lost and
unappreciated bliss long past he could not conceive that a stupid
chance letting the seven be dealt to the right rather than to the left 
might deprive him of all this happiness newly appreciated and newly
illumined and plunge him into the depths of unknown and undefined
misery that could not be yet he awaited with a sinking heart the
movement of d lokhov s hands those broad reddish hands with hairy
wrists visible from under the shirt cuffs laid down the pack and took
up a glass and a pipe that were handed him 

 so you are not afraid to play with me repeated d lokhov and as
if about to tell a good story he put down the cards leaned back in his
chair and began deliberately with a smile 

 yes gentlemen i ve been told there s a rumor going about moscow
that i m a sharper so i advise you to be careful 

 come now deal exclaimed rost v 

 oh those moscow gossips said d lokhov and he took up the cards
with a smile 

 aah rost v almost screamed lifting both hands to his head the
seven he needed was lying uppermost the first card in the pack he had
lost more than he could pay 

 still don t ruin yourself said d lokhov with a side glance at
rost v as he continued to deal 





chapter xiv

an hour and a half later most of the players were but little interested
in their own play 

the whole interest was concentrated on rost v instead of sixteen
hundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him 
which he had reckoned up to ten thousand but that now as he vaguely
supposed must have risen to fifteen thousand in reality it already
exceeded twenty thousand rubles d lokhov was no longer listening to
stories or telling them but followed every movement of rost v s
hands and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against him he had
decided to play until that score reached forty three thousand he
had fixed on that number because forty three was the sum of his and
s nya s joint ages rost v leaning his head on both hands sat at
the table which was scrawled over with figures wet with spilled wine 
and littered with cards one tormenting impression did not leave him 
that those broad boned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from
under the shirt sleeves those hands which he loved and hated held him
in their power 

 six hundred rubles ace a corner a nine winning it back s
impossible oh how pleasant it was at home the knave double or
quits it can t be and why is he doing this to me rost v
pondered sometimes he staked a large sum but d lokhov refused to
accept it and fixed the stake himself nicholas submitted to him and at
one moment prayed to god as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge
over the enns and then guessed that the card that came first to hand
from the crumpled heap under the table would save him now counted the
cords on his coat and took a card with that number and tried staking the
total of his losses on it then he looked round for aid from the other
players or peered at the now cold face of d lokhov and tried to read
what was passing in his mind 

 he knows of course what this loss means to me he can t want my
ruin wasn t he my friend wasn t i fond of him but it s not his
fault what s he to do if he has such luck and it s not my fault
either he thought to himself i have done nothing wrong have i
killed anyone or insulted or wished harm to anyone why such a terrible
misfortune and when did it begin such a little while ago i came to
this table with the thought of winning a hundred rubles to buy that
casket for mamma s name day and then going home i was so happy so
free so lighthearted and i did not realize how happy i was when did
that end and when did this new terrible state of things begin what
marked the change i sat all the time in this same place at this table 
chose and placed cards and watched those broad boned agile hands in the
same way when did it happen and what has happened i am well and strong
and still the same and in the same place no it can t be surely it
will all end in nothing 

he was flushed and bathed in perspiration though the room was not hot 
his face was terrible and piteous to see especially from its helpless
efforts to seem calm 

the score against him reached the fateful sum of forty three thousand 
rost v had just prepared a card by bending the corner of which he
meant to double the three thousand just put down to his score when
d lokhov slamming down the pack of cards put it aside and began
rapidly adding up the total of rost v s debt breaking the chalk as
he marked the figures in his clear bold hand 

 supper it s time for supper and here are the gypsies 

some swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold outside
and saying something in their gypsy accents nicholas understood that it
was all over but he said in an indifferent tone 

 well won t you go on i had a splendid card all ready as if it
were the fun of the game which interested him most 

 it s all up i m lost thought he now a bullet through my
brain that s all that s left me and at the same time he said
in a cheerful voice 

 come now just this one more little card 

 all right said d lokhov having finished the addition all
right twenty one rubles he said pointing to the figure twenty one
by which the total exceeded the round sum of forty three thousand and
taking up a pack he prepared to deal rost v submissively unbent the
corner of his card and instead of the six thousand he had intended 
carefully wrote twenty one 

 it s all the same to me he said i only want to see whether
you will let me win this ten or beat it 

d lokhov began to deal seriously oh how rost v detested at that
moment those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wrists 
which held him in their power the ten fell to him 

 you owe forty three thousand count said d lokhov and
stretching himself he rose from the table one does get tired sitting
so long he added 

 yes i m tired too said rost v 

d lokhov cut him short as if to remind him that it was not for him to
jest 

 when am i to receive the money count 

rost v flushing drew d lokhov into the next room 

 i cannot pay it all immediately will you take an i o u he said 

 i say rost v said d lokhov clearly smiling and looking
nicholas straight in the eyes you know the saying lucky in love 
unlucky at cards your cousin is in love with you i know 

 oh it s terrible to feel oneself so in this man s power 
thought rost v he knew what a shock he would inflict on his father and
mother by the news of this loss he knew what a relief it would be to
escape it all and felt that d lokhov knew that he could save him from
all this shame and sorrow but wanted now to play with him as a cat does
with a mouse 

 your cousin d lokhov started to say but nicholas interrupted
him 

 my cousin has nothing to do with this and it s not necessary to
mention her he exclaimed fiercely 

 then when am i to have it 

 tomorrow replied rost v and left the room 





chapter xv

to say tomorrow and keep up a dignified tone was not difficult 
but to go home alone see his sisters brother mother and father 
confess and ask for money he had no right to after giving his word of
honor was terrible 

at home they had not yet gone to bed the young people after returning
from the theater had had supper and were grouped round the clavichord 
as soon as nicholas entered he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphere
of love which pervaded the rost v household that winter and now after
d lokhov s proposal and iogel s ball seemed to have grown thicker
round s nya and nat sha as the air does before a thunderstorm s nya
and nat sha in the light blue dresses they had worn at the theater 
looking pretty and conscious of it were standing by the clavichord 
happy and smiling v ra was playing chess with shinsh n in the drawing
room the old countess waiting for the return of her husband and son 
sat playing patience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house 
den sov with sparkling eyes and ruffled hair sat at the clavichord
striking chords with his short fingers his legs thrown back and his
eyes rolling as he sang with his small husky but true voice some
verses called enchantress which he had composed and to which he
was trying to fit music 

 enchantress say to my forsaken lyre
 what magic power is this recalls me still 
 what spark has set my inmost soul on fire 
 what is this bliss that makes my fingers thrill 

he was singing in passionate tones gazing with his sparkling
black agate eyes at the frightened and happy nat sha 

 splendid excellent exclaimed nat sha another verse she
said without noticing nicholas 

 everything s still the same with them thought nicholas 
glancing into the drawing room where he saw v ra and his mother with
the old lady 

 ah and here s nicholas cried nat sha running up to him 

 is papa at home he asked 

 i am so glad you ve come said nat sha without answering him 
 we are enjoying ourselves vas li dm trich is staying a day longer
for my sake did you know 

 no papa is not back yet said s nya 

 nicholas have you come come here dear called the old countess
from the drawing room 

nicholas went to her kissed her hand and sitting down silently at her
table began to watch her hands arranging the cards from the dancing
room they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to persuade
nat sha to sing 

 all wight all wight shouted den sov it s no good making
excuses now it s your turn to sing the ba cawolla i entweat
you 

the countess glanced at her silent son 

 what is the matter she asked 

 oh nothing said he as if weary of being continually asked the
same question will papa be back soon 

 i expect so 

 everything s the same with them they know nothing about it where
am i to go thought nicholas and went again into the dancing room
where the clavichord stood 

s nya was sitting at the clavichord playing the prelude to
den sov s favorite barcarolle nat sha was preparing to sing 
den sov was looking at her with enraptured eyes 

nicholas began pacing up and down the room 

 why do they want to make her sing how can she sing there s
nothing to be happy about thought he 

s nya struck the first chord of the prelude 

 my god i m a ruined and dishonored man a bullet through my brain
is the only thing left me not singing his thoughts ran on go
away but where to it s one let them sing 

he continued to pace the room looking gloomily at den sov and the
girls and avoiding their eyes 

 nik lenka what is the matter s nya s eyes fixed on him
seemed to ask she noticed at once that something had happened to him 

nicholas turned away from her nat sha too with her quick instinct 
had instantly noticed her brother s condition but though she noticed
it she was herself in such high spirits at that moment so far from
sorrow sadness or self reproach that she purposely deceived herself
as young people often do no i am too happy now to spoil my
enjoyment by sympathy with anyone s sorrow she felt and she said
to herself no i must be mistaken he must be feeling happy just as
i am 

 now s nya she said going to the very middle of the room where
she considered the resonance was best 

having lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly as ballet
dancers do nat sha rising energetically from her heels to her toes 
stepped to the middle of the room and stood still 

 yes that s me she seemed to say answering the rapt gaze with
which den sov followed her 

 and what is she so pleased about thought nicholas looking at his
sister why isn t she dull and ashamed 

nat sha took the first note her throat swelled her chest rose 
her eyes became serious at that moment she was oblivious of her
surroundings and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may
produce at the same intervals and hold for the same time but which
leave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrill
you and make you weep 

nat sha that winter had for the first time begun to sing seriously 
mainly because den sov so delighted in her singing she no longer sang
as a child there was no longer in her singing that comical childish 
painstaking effect that had been in it before but she did not yet sing
well as all the connoisseurs who heard her said it is not trained 
but it is a beautiful voice that must be trained only they generally
said this some time after she had finished singing while that untrained
voice with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions was
sounding even the connoisseurs said nothing but only delighted in
it and wished to hear it again in her voice there was a virginal
freshness an unconsciousness of her own powers and an as yet untrained
velvety softness which so mingled with her lack of art in singing that
it seemed as if nothing in that voice could be altered without spoiling
it 

 what is this thought nicholas listening to her with widely
opened eyes what has happened to her how she is singing today 
and suddenly the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the
next note the next phrase and everything in the world was divided into
three beats oh mio crudele affetto one two three one 
two three one oh mio crudele affetto one two three 
one oh this senseless life of ours thought nicholas all
this misery and money and d lokhov and anger and honor it s all
nonsense but this is real now then nat sha now then dearest 
now then darling how will she take that si she s taken it thank
god and without noticing that he was singing to strengthen the si
he sung a second a third below the high note ah god how fine did
i really take it how fortunate he thought 

oh how that chord vibrated and how moved was something that was finest
in rost v s soul and this something was apart from everything else
in the world and above everything in the world what were losses and
d lokhov and words of honor all nonsense one might kill and rob
and yet be happy 





chapter xvi

it was long since rost v had felt such enjoyment from music as he
did that day but no sooner had nat sha finished her barcarolle than
reality again presented itself he got up without saying a word and went
downstairs to his own room a quarter of an hour later the old count
came in from his club cheerful and contented nicholas hearing him
drive up went to meet him 

 well had a good time said the old count smiling gaily and
proudly at his son 

nicholas tried to say yes but could not and he nearly burst into
sobs the count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his son s
condition 

 ah it can t be avoided thought nicholas for the first and
last time and suddenly in the most casual tone which made him feel
ashamed of himself he said as if merely asking his father to let him
have the carriage to drive to town 

 papa i have come on a matter of business i was nearly forgetting i
need some money 

 dear me said his father who was in a specially good humor i
told you it would not be enough how much 

 very much said nicholas flushing and with a stupid careless
smile for which he was long unable to forgive himself i have lost a
little i mean a good deal a great deal forty three thousand 

 what to whom nonsense cried the count suddenly reddening
with an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do 

 i promised to pay tomorrow said nicholas 

 well said the old count spreading out his arms and sinking
helplessly on the sofa 

 it can t be helped it happens to everyone said the son with
a bold free and easy tone while in his soul he regarded himself as a
worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime he
longed to kiss his father s hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness 
but said in a careless and even rude voice that it happens to
everyone 

the old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son s words and began
bustlingly searching for something 

 yes yes he muttered it will be difficult i fear difficult
to raise happens to everybody yes who has not done it 

and with a furtive glance at his son s face the count went out of the
room nicholas had been prepared for resistance but had not at all
expected this 

 papa pa pa he called after him sobbing forgive me and
seizing his father s hand he pressed it to his lips and burst into
tears 

while father and son were having their explanation the mother and
daughter were having one not less important nat sha came running to
her mother quite excited 

 mamma mamma he has made me 

 made what 

 made made me an offer mamma mamma she exclaimed 

the countess did not believe her ears den sov had proposed to whom 
to this chit of a girl nat sha who not so long ago was playing with
dolls and who was still having lessons 

 don t nat sha what nonsense she said hoping it was a joke 

 nonsense indeed i am telling you the fact said nat sha
indignantly i come to ask you what to do and you call it
 nonsense 

the countess shrugged her shoulders 

 if it is true that monsieur den sov has made you a proposal tell
him he is a fool that s all 

 no he s not a fool replied nat sha indignantly and seriously 

 well then what do you want you re all in love nowadays well 
if you are in love marry him said the countess with a laugh of
annoyance good luck to you 

 no mamma i m not in love with him i suppose i m not in love
with him 

 well then tell him so 

 mamma are you cross don t be cross dear is it my fault 

 no but what is it my dear do you want me to go and tell him 
said the countess smiling 

 no i will do it myself only tell me what to say it s all very
well for you said nat sha with a responsive smile you should
have seen how he said it i know he did not mean to say it but it came
out accidently 

 well all the same you must refuse him 

 no i mustn t i am so sorry for him he s so nice 

 well then accept his offer it s high time for you to be
married answered the countess sharply and sarcastically 

 no mamma but i m so sorry for him i don t know how i m to
say it 

 and there s nothing for you to say i shall speak to him myself 
said the countess indignant that they should have dared to treat this
little nat sha as grown up 

 no not on any account i will tell him myself and you ll listen
at the door and nat sha ran across the drawing room to the dancing
hall where den sov was sitting on the same chair by the clavichord
with his face in his hands 

he jumped up at the sound of her light step 

 nataly he said moving with rapid steps toward her decide my
fate it is in your hands 

 vas li dm trich i m so sorry for you no but you are so
nice but it won t do not that but as a friend i shall always
love you 

den sov bent over her hand and she heard strange sounds she did not
understand she kissed his rough curly black head at this instant they
heard the quick rustle of the countess dress she came up to them 

 vas li dm trich i thank you for the honor she said with an
embarrassed voice though it sounded severe to den sov but my
daughter is so young and i thought that as my son s friend you
would have addressed yourself first to me in that case you would not
have obliged me to give this refusal 

 countess said den sov with downcast eyes and a guilty face 
he tried to say more but faltered 

nat sha could not remain calm seeing him in such a plight she began
to sob aloud 

 countess i have done w ong den sov went on in an unsteady
voice but believe me i so adore your daughter and all your family
that i would give my life twice over he looked at the countess 
and seeing her severe face said well good by countess and
kissing her hand he left the room with quick resolute strides without
looking at nat sha 


next day rost v saw den sov off he did not wish to stay another
day in moscow all den sov s moscow friends gave him a farewell
entertainment at the gypsies with the result that he had no
recollection of how he was put in the sleigh or of the first three
stages of his journey 

after den sov s departure rost v spent another fortnight in moscow 
without going out of the house waiting for the money his father could
not at once raise and he spent most of his time in the girls room 

s nya was more tender and devoted to him than ever it was as if she
wanted to show him that his losses were an achievement that made her
love him all the more but nicholas now considered himself unworthy of
her 

he filled the girls albums with verses and music and having at last
sent d lokhov the whole forty three thousand rubles and received his
receipt he left at the end of november without taking leave of any of
his acquaintances to overtake his regiment which was already in poland 





book five 1806 07





chapter i

after his interview with his wife pierre left for petersburg at the
torzh k post station either there were no horses or the postmaster
would not supply them pierre was obliged to wait without undressing 
he lay down on the leather sofa in front of a round table put his big
feet in their overboots on the table and began to reflect 

 will you have the portmanteaus brought in and a bed got ready and
tea asked his valet 

pierre gave no answer for he neither heard nor saw anything he had
begun to think of the last station and was still pondering on the same
question one so important that he took no notice of what went
on around him not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to
petersburg earlier or later or whether he secured accommodation at this
station but compared to the thoughts that now occupied him it was a
matter of indifference whether he remained there for a few hours or for
the rest of his life 

the postmaster his wife the valet and a peasant woman selling
torzh k embroidery came into the room offering their services 
without changing his careless attitude pierre looked at them over his
spectacles unable to understand what they wanted or how they could go on
living without having solved the problems that so absorbed him he had
been engrossed by the same thoughts ever since the day he returned from
sok lniki after the duel and had spent that first agonizing sleepless
night but now in the solitude of the journey they seized him with
special force no matter what he thought about he always returned to
these same questions which he could not solve and yet could not cease to
ask himself it was as if the thread of the chief screw which held his
life together were stripped so that the screw could not get in or out 
but went on turning uselessly in the same place 

the postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his excellency to
wait only two hours when come what might he would let his excellency
have the courier horses it was plain that he was lying and only wanted
to get more money from the traveler 

 is this good or bad pierre asked himself it is good for me 
bad for another traveler and for himself it s unavoidable because
he needs money for food the man said an officer had once given him a
thrashing for letting a private traveler have the courier horses 
but the officer thrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as
possible and i continued pierre shot d lokhov because i
considered myself injured and louis xvi was executed because they
considered him a criminal and a year later they executed those who
executed him also for some reason what is bad what is good what
should one love and what hate what does one live for and what am i 
what is life and what is death what power governs all 

there was no answer to any of these questions except one and that
not a logical answer and not at all a reply to them the answer was 
 you ll die and all will end you ll die and know all or cease
asking but dying was also dreadful 

the torzh k peddler woman in a whining voice went on offering her
wares especially a pair of goatskin slippers i have hundreds of
rubles i don t know what to do with and she stands in her tattered
cloak looking timidly at me he thought and what does she
want the money for as if that money could add a hair s breadth to
happiness or peace of mind can anything in the world make her or me
less a prey to evil and death death which ends all and must come
today or tomorrow at any rate in an instant as compared with
eternity and again he twisted the screw with the stripped thread 
and again it turned uselessly in the same place 

his servant handed him a half cut novel in the form of letters by
madame de souza he began reading about the sufferings and virtuous
struggles of a certain emilie de mansfeld and why did she resist
her seducer when she loved him he thought god could not have put
into her heart an impulse that was against his will my wife as she
once was did not struggle and perhaps she was right nothing has been
found out nothing discovered pierre again said to himself all
we can know is that we know nothing and that s the height of human
wisdom 

everything within and around him seemed confused senseless and
repellent yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances pierre
found a kind of tantalizing satisfaction 

 i make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for this
gentleman said the postmaster entering the room followed by another
traveler also detained for lack of horses 

the newcomer was a short large boned yellow faced wrinkled old
man with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite
grayish color 

pierre took his feet off the table stood up and lay down on a bed that
had been got ready for him glancing now and then at the newcomer who 
with a gloomy and tired face was wearily taking off his wraps with the
aid of his servant and not looking at pierre with a pair of felt boots
on his thin bony legs and keeping on a worn nankeen covered sheepskin
coat the traveler sat down on the sofa leaned back his big head with
its broad temples and close cropped hair and looked at bez khov the
stern shrewd and penetrating expression of that look struck pierre he
felt a wish to speak to the stranger but by the time he had made up his
mind to ask him a question about the roads the traveler had closed his
eyes his shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of
them pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a
death s head the stranger sat without stirring either resting or as
it seemed to pierre sunk in profound and calm meditation his servant
was also a yellow wrinkled old man without beard or mustache 
evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grown 
this active old servant was unpacking the traveler s canteen and
preparing tea he brought in a boiling samovar when everything was
ready the stranger opened his eyes moved to the table filled a
tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whom
he passed it pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness and the
need even the inevitability of entering into conversation with this
stranger 

the servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down with an
unfinished bit of nibbled sugar and asked if anything more would be
wanted 

 to indicate he did not want more tea 

 no give me the book said the stranger 

the servant handed him a book which pierre took to be a devotional work 
and the traveler became absorbed in it pierre looked at him all at
once the stranger closed the book putting in a marker and again 
leaning with his arms on the back of the sofa sat in his former
position with his eyes shut pierre looked at him and had not time
to turn away when the old man opening his eyes fixed his steady and
severe gaze straight on pierre s face 

pierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look but the bright old
eyes attracted him irresistibly 





chapter ii

 i have the pleasure of addressing count bez khov if i am not
mistaken said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voice 

pierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles 

 i have heard of you my dear sir continued the stranger and
of your misfortune he seemed to emphasize the last word as if to
say yes misfortune call it what you please i know that what
happened to you in moscow was a misfortune i regret it very
much my dear sir 

pierre flushed and hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed bent
forward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile 

 i have not referred to this out of curiosity my dear sir but for
greater reasons 

he paused his gaze still on pierre and moved aside on the sofa by way
of inviting the other to take a seat beside him pierre felt reluctant
to enter into conversation with this old man but submitting to him
involuntarily came up and sat down beside him 

 you are unhappy my dear sir the stranger continued you
are young and i am old i should like to help you as far as lies in my
power 

 oh yes said pierre with a forced smile i am very grateful
to you where are you traveling from 

the stranger s face was not genial it was even cold and severe but
in spite of this both the face and words of his new acquaintance were
irresistibly attractive to pierre 

 but if for any reason you don t feel inclined to talk to me 
said the old man say so my dear sir and he suddenly smiled in
an unexpected and tenderly paternal way 

 oh no not at all on the contrary i am very glad to make your
acquaintance said pierre and again glancing at the stranger s
hands he looked more closely at the ring with its skull a masonic
sign 

 allow me to ask he said are you a mason 

 yes i belong to the brotherhood of the freemasons said the
stranger looking deeper and deeper into pierre s eyes and in
their name and my own i hold out a brotherly hand to you 

 i am afraid said pierre smiling and wavering between the
confidence the personality of the freemason inspired in him and his own
habit of ridiculing the masonic beliefs i am afraid i am very far
from understanding how am i to put it i am afraid my way of looking
at the world is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one
another 

 i know your outlook said the mason and the view of life you
mention and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts 
is the one held by the majority of people and is the invariable fruit
of pride indolence and ignorance forgive me my dear sir but if i
had not known it i should not have addressed you your view of life is a
regrettable delusion 

 just as i may suppose you to be deluded said pierre with a faint
smile 

 i should never dare to say that i know the truth said the mason 
whose words struck pierre more and more by their precision and firmness 
 no one can attain to truth by himself only by laying stone on stone
with the cooperation of all by the millions of generations from our
forefather adam to our own times is that temple reared which is to be
a worthy dwelling place of the great god he added and closed his
eyes 

 i ought to tell you that i do not believe do not believe in
god said pierre regretfully and with an effort feeling it
essential to speak the whole truth 

the mason looked intently at pierre and smiled as a rich man with
millions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him that he poor
man had not the five rubles that would make him happy 

 yes you do not know him my dear sir said the mason you
cannot know him you do not know him and that is why you are unhappy 

 yes yes i am unhappy assented pierre but what am i to
do 

 you know him not my dear sir and so you are very unhappy you do
not know him but he is here he is in me he is in my words he is in
thee and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just uttered 
pronounced the mason in a stern and tremulous voice 

he paused and sighed evidently trying to calm himself 

 if he were not he said quietly you and i would not be
speaking of him my dear sir of what of whom are we speaking whom
hast thou denied he suddenly asked with exulting austerity and
authority in his voice who invented him if he did not exist whence
came thy conception of the existence of such an incomprehensible being 
didst thou and why did the whole world conceive the idea of the
existence of such an incomprehensible being a being all powerful 
eternal and infinite in all his attributes 

he stopped and remained silent for a long time 

pierre could not and did not wish to break this silence 

 he exists but to understand him is hard the mason began again 
looking not at pierre but straight before him and turning the leaves
of his book with his old hands which from excitement he could not keep
still if it were a man whose existence thou didst doubt i could
bring him to thee could take him by the hand and show him to thee but
how can i an insignificant mortal show his omnipotence his infinity 
and all his mercy to one who is blind or who shuts his eyes that he may
not see or understand him and may not see or understand his own vileness
and sinfulness he paused again who art thou thou dreamest that
thou art wise because thou couldst utter those blasphemous words he
went on with a somber and scornful smile and thou art more foolish
and unreasonable than a little child who playing with the parts of a
skillfully made watch dares to say that as he does not understand
its use he does not believe in the master who made it to know him is
hard for ages from our forefather adam to our own day we labor to
attain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim but
in our lack of understanding we see only our weakness and his
greatness 

pierre listened with swelling heart gazing into the mason s face with
shining eyes not interrupting or questioning him but believing with
his whole soul what the stranger said whether he accepted the wise
reasoning contained in the mason s words or believed as a child
believes in the speaker s tone of conviction and earnestness or
the tremor of the speaker s voice which sometimes almost broke or
those brilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction or the calm
firmness and certainty of his vocation which radiated from his whole
being and which struck pierre especially by contrast with his own
dejection and hopelessness at any rate pierre longed with his whole
soul to believe and he did believe and felt a joyful sense of comfort 
regeneration and return to life 

 he is not to be apprehended by reason but by life said the
mason 

 i do not understand said pierre feeling with dismay doubts
reawakening he was afraid of any want of clearness any weakness in
the mason s arguments he dreaded not to be able to believe in him 
 i don t understand he said how it is that the mind of man
cannot attain the knowledge of which you speak 

the mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile 

 the highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wish
to imbibe he said can i receive that pure liquid into an impure
vessel and judge of its purity only by the inner purification of myself
can i retain in some degree of purity the liquid i receive 

 yes yes that is so said pierre joyfully 

 the highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone not on those
worldly sciences of physics history chemistry and the like into
which intellectual knowledge is divided the highest wisdom is one 
the highest wisdom has but one science the science of the whole the
science explaining the whole creation and man s place in it to
receive that science it is necessary to purify and renew one s inner
self and so before one can know it is necessary to believe and to
perfect one s self and to attain this end we have the light called
conscience that god has implanted in our souls 

 yes yes assented pierre 

 look then at thy inner self with the eyes of the spirit and ask
thyself whether thou art content with thyself what hast thou attained
relying on reason only what art thou you are young you are rich you
are clever you are well educated and what have you done with all these
good gifts are you content with yourself and with your life 

 no i hate my life pierre muttered wincing 

 thou hatest it then change it purify thyself and as thou art
purified thou wilt gain wisdom look at your life my dear sir 
how have you spent it in riotous orgies and debauchery receiving
everything from society and giving nothing in return you have become
the possessor of wealth how have you used it what have you done
for your neighbor have you ever thought of your tens of thousands
of slaves have you helped them physically and morally no you have
profited by their toil to lead a profligate life that is what you have
done have you chosen a post in which you might be of service to your
neighbor no you have spent your life in idleness then you married my
dear sir took on yourself responsibility for the guidance of a young
woman and what have you done you have not helped her to find the way
of truth my dear sir but have thrust her into an abyss of deceit and
misery a man offended you and you shot him and you say you do not
know god and hate your life there is nothing strange in that my dear
sir 

after these words the mason as if tired by his long discourse again
leaned his arms on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes pierre
looked at that aged stern motionless almost lifeless face and moved
his lips without uttering a sound he wished to say yes a vile 
idle vicious life but dared not break the silence 

the mason cleared his throat huskily as old men do and called his
servant 

 how about the horses he asked without looking at pierre 

 the exchange horses have just come answered the servant will
you not rest here 

 no tell them to harness 

 can he really be going away leaving me alone without having told me
all and without promising to help me thought pierre rising with
downcast head and he began to pace the room glancing occasionally at
the mason yes i never thought of it but i have led a contemptible
and profligate life though i did not like it and did not want to 
thought pierre but this man knows the truth and if he wished to 
could disclose it to me 

pierre wished to say this to the mason but did not dare to the
traveler having packed his things with his practiced hands began
fastening his coat when he had finished he turned to bez khov and
said in a tone of indifferent politeness 

 where are you going to now my dear sir 

 i i m going to petersburg answered pierre in a childlike 
hesitating voice i thank you i agree with all you have said but
do not suppose me to be so bad with my whole soul i wish to be what you
would have me be but i have never had help from anyone but it is
i above all who am to blame for everything help me teach me and
perhaps i may 

pierre could not go on he gulped and turned away 

the mason remained silent for a long time evidently considering 

 help comes from god alone he said but such measure of help as
our order can bestow it will render you my dear sir you are going to
petersburg hand this to count willarski he took out his notebook
and wrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded in four 
 allow me to give you a piece of advice when you reach the capital 
first of all devote some time to solitude and self examination and do
not resume your former way of life and now i wish you a good journey 
my dear sir he added seeing that his servant had entered and
success 

the traveler was joseph alex evich bazd ev as pierre saw from the
postmaster s book bazd ev had been one of the best known freemasons
and martinists even in nov kov s time for a long while after he had
gone pierre did not go to bed or order horses but paced up and down
the room pondering over his vicious past and with a rapturous sense
of beginning anew pictured to himself the blissful irreproachable 
virtuous future that seemed to him so easy it seemed to him that he had
been vicious only because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to
be virtuous not a trace of his former doubts remained in his soul he
firmly believed in the possibility of the brotherhood of men united in
the aim of supporting one another in the path of virtue and that is how
freemasonry presented itself to him 





chapter iii

on reaching petersburg pierre did not let anyone know of his arrival 
he went nowhere and spent whole days in reading thomas kempis whose
book had been sent him by someone unknown one thing he continually
realized as he read that book the joy hitherto unknown to him 
of believing in the possibility of attaining perfection and in the
possibility of active brotherly love among men which joseph alex evich
had revealed to him a week after his arrival the young polish count 
willarski whom pierre had known slightly in petersburg society came
into his room one evening in the official and ceremonious manner in
which d lokhov s second had called on him and having closed the
door behind him and satisfied himself that there was nobody else in the
room addressed pierre 

 i have come to you with a message and an offer count he
said without sitting down a person of very high standing in our
brotherhood has made application for you to be received into our order
before the usual term and has proposed to me to be your sponsor i
consider it a sacred duty to fulfill that person s wishes do you wish
to enter the brotherhood of freemasons under my sponsorship 

the cold austere tone of this man whom he had almost always before met
at balls amiably smiling in the society of the most brilliant women 
surprised pierre 

 yes i do wish it said he 

willarski bowed his head 

 one more question count he said which i beg you to answer
in all sincerity not as a future mason but as an honest man have you
renounced your former convictions do you believe in god 

pierre considered 

 yes yes i believe in god he said 

 in that case began willarski but pierre interrupted him 

 yes i do believe in god he repeated 

 in that case we can go said willarski my carriage is at your
service 

willarski was silent throughout the drive to pierre s inquiries as
to what he must do and how he should answer willarski only replied that
brothers more worthy than he would test him and that pierre had only to
tell the truth 

having entered the courtyard of a large house where the lodge had its
headquarters and having ascended a dark staircase they entered a small
well lit anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the aid of
a servant from there they passed into another room a man in strange
attire appeared at the door willarski stepping toward him said
something to him in french in an undertone and then went up to a small
wardrobe in which pierre noticed garments such as he had never seen
before having taken a kerchief from the cupboard willarski bound
pierre s eyes with it and tied it in a knot behind catching some
hairs painfully in the knot then he drew his face down kissed him and
taking him by the hand led him forward the hairs tied in the knot hurt
pierre and there were lines of pain on his face and a shamefaced smile 
his huge figure with arms hanging down and with a puckered though
smiling face moved after willarski with uncertain timid steps 

having led him about ten paces willarski stopped 

 whatever happens to you he said you must bear it all manfully
if you have firmly resolved to join our brotherhood pierre nodded
affirmatively when you hear a knock at the door you will uncover
your eyes added willarski i wish you courage and success 
and pressing pierre s hand he went out 

left alone pierre went on smiling in the same way once or twice
he shrugged his shoulders and raised his hand to the kerchief as if
wishing to take it off but let it drop again the five minutes spent
with his eyes bandaged seemed to him an hour his arms felt numb 
his legs almost gave way it seemed to him that he was tired out he
experienced a variety of most complex sensations he felt afraid of what
would happen to him and still more afraid of showing his fear he felt
curious to know what was going to happen and what would be revealed to
him but most of all he felt joyful that the moment had come when he
would at last start on that path of regeneration and on the actively
virtuous life of which he had been dreaming since he met joseph
alex evich loud knocks were heard at the door pierre took the bandage
off his eyes and glanced around him the room was in black darkness 
only a small lamp was burning inside something white pierre went nearer
and saw that the lamp stood on a black table on which lay an open book 
the book was the gospel and the white thing with the lamp inside was a
human skull with its cavities and teeth after reading the first words
of the gospel in the beginning was the word and the word was with
god pierre went round the table and saw a large open box filled
with something it was a coffin with bones inside he was not at all
surprised by what he saw hoping to enter on an entirely new life quite
unlike the old one he expected everything to be unusual even more
unusual than what he was seeing a skull a coffin the gospel it
seemed to him that he had expected all this and even more trying
to stimulate his emotions he looked around god death love the
brotherhood of man he kept saying to himself associating these
words with vague yet joyful ideas the door opened and someone came in 

by the dim light to which pierre had already become accustomed he
saw a rather short man having evidently come from the light into the
darkness the man paused then moved with cautious steps toward the
table and placed on it his small leather gloved hands 

this short man had on a white leather apron which covered his chest and
part of his legs he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a high
white ruffle outlining his rather long face which was lit up from
below 

 for what have you come hither asked the newcomer turning in
pierre s direction at a slight rustle made by the latter why have
you who do not believe in the truth of the light and who have not
seen the light come here what do you seek from us wisdom virtue 
enlightenment 

at the moment the door opened and the stranger came in pierre felt a
sense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood at
confession he felt himself in the presence of one socially a complete
stranger yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man with bated
breath and beating heart he moved toward the rhetor by which name the
brother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the brotherhood was
known drawing nearer he recognized in the rhetor a man he knew 
smolyan nov and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was an
acquaintance he wished him simply a brother and a virtuous instructor 
for a long time he could not utter a word so that the rhetor had to
repeat his question 

 yes i i desire regeneration pierre uttered with
difficulty 

 very well said smolyan nov and went on at once have you any
idea of the means by which our holy order will help you to reach your
aim said he quietly and quickly 

 i hope for guidance help in regeneration said pierre 
with a trembling voice and some difficulty in utterance due to his
excitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in
russian 

 what is your conception of freemasonry 

 i imagine that freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men who
have virtuous aims said pierre feeling ashamed of the inadequacy
of his words for the solemnity of the moment as he spoke i
imagine 

 good said the rhetor quickly apparently satisfied with
this answer have you sought for means of attaining your aim in
religion 

 no i considered it erroneous and did not follow it said pierre 
so softly that the rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was
saying i have been an atheist answered pierre 

 you are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life 
therefore you seek wisdom and virtue is that not so said the
rhetor after a moment s pause 

 yes yes assented pierre 

the rhetor cleared his throat crossed his gloved hands on his breast 
and began to speak 

 now i must disclose to you the chief aim of our order he said 
 and if this aim coincides with yours you may enter our brotherhood
with profit the first and chief object of our order the foundation on
which it rests and which no human power can destroy is the preservation
and handing on to posterity of a certain important mystery which
has come down to us from the remotest ages even from the first man a
mystery on which perhaps the fate of mankind depends but since this
mystery is of such a nature that nobody can know or use it unless he be
prepared by long and diligent self purification not everyone can hope
to attain it quickly hence we have a secondary aim that of preparing
our members as much as possible to reform their hearts to purify and
enlighten their minds by means handed on to us by tradition from those
who have striven to attain this mystery and thereby to render them
capable of receiving it 

 by purifying and regenerating our members we try thirdly to improve
the whole human race offering it in our members an example of piety
and virtue and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil which
sways the world think this over and i will come to you again 

 to combat the evil which sways the world pierre repeated and a
mental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his mind 
he imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago and he
addressed an edifying exhortation to them he imagined to himself
vicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and deed 
imagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue of the three
objects mentioned by the rhetor this last that of improving mankind 
especially appealed to pierre the important mystery mentioned by the
rhetor though it aroused his curiosity did not seem to him essential 
and the second aim that of purifying and regenerating himself did not
much interest him because at that moment he felt with delight that he
was already perfectly cured of his former faults and was ready for all
that was good 

half an hour later the rhetor returned to inform the seeker of the
seven virtues corresponding to the seven steps of solomon s temple 
which every freemason should cultivate in himself these virtues were 
1 discretion the keeping of the secrets of the order 2 obedience to
those of higher ranks in the order 3 morality 4 love of mankind 5 
courage 6 generosity 7 the love of death 

 in the seventh place try by the frequent thought of death the
rhetor said to bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe but
as a friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue
from this distressful life and leads it to its place of recompense and
peace 

 yes that must be so thought pierre when after these words the
rhetor went away leaving him to solitary meditation it must be so 
but i am still so weak that i love my life the meaning of which is only
now gradually opening before me but five of the other virtues which
pierre recalled counting them on his fingers he felt already in his
soul courage generosity morality love of mankind and especially
obedience which did not even seem to him a virtue but a joy he now
felt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to submit his will
to those who knew the indubitable truth he forgot what the seventh
virtue was and could not recall it 

the third time the rhetor came back more quickly and asked pierre
whether he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit to
all that would be required of him 

 i am ready for everything said pierre 

 i must also inform you said the rhetor that our order
delivers its teaching not in words only but also by other means which
may perhaps have a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after wisdom
and virtue than mere words this chamber with what you see therein
should already have suggested to your heart if it is sincere more than
words could do you will perhaps also see in your further initiation a
like method of enlightenment our order imitates the ancient societies
that explained their teaching by hieroglyphics a hieroglyph said
the rhetor is an emblem of something not cognizable by the senses
but which possesses qualities resembling those of the symbol 

pierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was but dared not speak he
listened to the rhetor in silence feeling from all he said that his
ordeal was about to begin 

 if you are resolved i must begin your initiation said the rhetor
coming closer to pierre in token of generosity i ask you to give me
all your valuables 

 but i have nothing here replied pierre supposing that he was
asked to give up all he possessed 

 what you have with you watch money rings 

pierre quickly took out his purse and watch but could not manage for
some time to get the wedding ring off his fat finger when that had been
done the rhetor said 

 in token of obedience i ask you to undress 

pierre took off his coat waistcoat and left boot according to the
rhetor s instructions the mason drew the shirt back from pierre s
left breast and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his trousers
to above the knee pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot also
and was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger the
trouble but the mason told him that was not necessary and gave him
a slipper for his left foot with a childlike smile of embarrassment 
doubt and self derision which appeared on his face against his will 
pierre stood with his arms hanging down and legs apart before his
brother rhetor and awaited his further commands 

 and now in token of candor i ask you to reveal to me your chief
passion said the latter 

 my passion i have had so many replied pierre 

 that passion which more than all others caused you to waver on the
path of virtue said the mason 

pierre paused seeking a reply 

 wine gluttony idleness laziness irritability anger women 
he went over his vices in his mind not knowing to which of them to give
the pre eminence 

 women he said in a low scarcely audible voice 

the mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after this
answer at last he moved up to pierre and taking the kerchief that lay
on the table again bound his eyes 

 for the last time i say to you turn all your attention upon
yourself put a bridle on your senses and seek blessedness not in
passion but in your own heart the source of blessedness is not without
us but within 

pierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing source
of blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotion 





chapter iv

soon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch pierre not
the rhetor but pierre s sponsor willarski whom he recognized by his
voice to fresh questions as to the firmness of his resolution pierre
replied yes yes i agree and with a beaming childlike smile 
his fat chest uncovered stepping unevenly and timidly in one slippered
and one booted foot he advanced while willarski held a sword to his
bare chest he was conducted from that room along passages that turned
backwards and forwards and was at last brought to the doors of the
lodge willarski coughed he was answered by the masonic knock with
mallets the doors opened before them a bass voice pierre was still
blindfolded questioned him as to who he was when and where he was
born and so on then he was again led somewhere still blindfolded 
and as they went along he was told allegories of the toils of his
pilgrimage of holy friendship of the eternal architect of the
universe and of the courage with which he should endure toils and
dangers during these wanderings pierre noticed that he was spoken
of now as the seeker now as the sufferer and now as the
 postulant to the accompaniment of various knockings with
mallets and swords as he was being led up to some object he noticed a
hesitation and uncertainty among his conductors he heard those around
him disputing in whispers and one of them insisting that he should be
led along a certain carpet after that they took his right hand placed
it on something and told him to hold a pair of compasses to his left
breast with the other hand and to repeat after someone who read aloud
an oath of fidelity to the laws of the order the candles were then
extinguished and some spirit lighted as pierre knew by the smell and
he was told that he would now see the lesser light the bandage was
taken off his eyes and by the faint light of the burning spirit 
pierre as in a dream saw several men standing before him wearing
aprons like the rhetor s and holding swords in their hands pointed at
his breast among them stood a man whose white shirt was stained with
blood on seeing this pierre moved forward with his breast toward the
swords meaning them to pierce it but the swords were drawn back from
him and he was at once blindfolded again 

 now thou hast seen the lesser light uttered a voice then the
candles were relit and he was told that he would see the full light the
bandage was again removed and more than ten voices said together sic
transit gloria mundi 

pierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room
and at the people in it round a long table covered with black sat some
twelve men in garments like those he had already seen some of them
pierre had met in petersburg society in the president s chair sat a
young man he did not know with a peculiar cross hanging from his
neck on his right sat the italian abb whom pierre had met at
anna p vlovna s two years before there were also present a very
distinguished dignitary and a swiss who had formerly been tutor at the
kur gins all maintained a solemn silence listening to the words
of the president who held a mallet in his hand let into the wall was
a star shaped light at one side of the table was a small carpet with
various figures worked upon it at the other was something resembling an
altar on which lay a testament and a skull round it stood seven large
candlesticks like those used in churches two of the brothers led pierre
up to the altar placed his feet at right angles and bade him lie down 
saying that he must prostrate himself at the gates of the temple 

 he must first receive the trowel whispered one of the brothers 

 oh hush please said another 

pierre perplexed looked round with his shortsighted eyes without
obeying and suddenly doubts arose in his mind where am i what am
i doing aren t they laughing at me shan t i be ashamed to remember
this but these doubts only lasted a moment pierre glanced at
the serious faces of those around remembered all he had already gone
through and realized that he could not stop halfway he was aghast
at his hesitation and trying to arouse his former devotional feeling 
prostrated himself before the gates of the temple and really the
feeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before when
he had lain there some time he was told to get up and a white leather
apron such as the others wore was put on him he was given a trowel
and three pairs of gloves and then the grand master addressed him he
told him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness of that
apron which symbolized strength and purity then of the unexplained
trowel he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from vice 
and indulgently to smooth with it the heart of his neighbor as to the
first pair of gloves a man s he said that pierre could not know
their meaning but must keep them the second pair of man s gloves
he was to wear at the meetings and finally of the third a pair of
women s gloves he said dear brother these woman s gloves are
intended for you too give them to the woman whom you shall honor most
of all this gift will be a pledge of your purity of heart to her whom
you select to be your worthy helpmeet in masonry and after a pause 
he added but beware dear brother that these gloves do not deck
hands that are unclean while the grand master said these last words
it seemed to pierre that he grew embarrassed pierre himself grew still
more confused blushed like a child till tears came to his eyes began
looking about him uneasily and an awkward pause followed 

this silence was broken by one of the brethren who led pierre up to the
rug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation of
all the figures on it the sun the moon a hammer a plumb line a
trowel a rough stone and a squared stone a pillar three windows and
so on then a place was assigned to pierre he was shown the signs of
the lodge told the password and at last was permitted to sit down 
the grand master began reading the statutes they were very long and
pierre from joy agitation and embarrassment was not in a state to
understand what was being read he managed to follow only the last words
of the statutes and these remained in his mind 

 in our temples we recognize no other distinctions read the grand
master but those between virtue and vice beware of making any
distinctions which may infringe equality fly to a brother s aid
whoever he may be exhort him who goeth astray raise him that falleth 
never bear malice or enmity toward thy brother be kindly and courteous 
kindle in all hearts the flame of virtue share thy happiness with thy
neighbor and may envy never dim the purity of that bliss forgive thy
enemy do not avenge thyself except by doing him good thus fulfilling
the highest law thou shalt regain traces of the ancient dignity which
thou hast lost 

he finished and getting up embraced and kissed pierre who with tears
of joy in his eyes looked round him not knowing how to answer the
congratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on all
sides he acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these men only
brothers and burned with impatience to set to work with them 

the grand master rapped with his mallet all the masons sat down in
their places and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity of
humility 

the grand master proposed that the last duty should be performed 
and the distinguished dignitary who bore the title of collector
of alms went round to all the brothers pierre would have liked
to subscribe all he had but fearing that it might look like pride
subscribed the same amount as the others 

the meeting was at an end and on reaching home pierre felt as if he had
returned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years had
become completely changed and had quite left behind his former habits
and way of life 





chapter v

the day after he had been received into the lodge pierre was sitting at
home reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the square 
one side of which symbolized god another moral things a third
physical things and the fourth a combination of these now and then
his attention wandered from the book and the square and he formed in
imagination a new plan of life on the previous evening at the lodge he
had heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the emperor and that it
would be wiser for him to leave petersburg pierre proposed going to his
estates in the south and there attending to the welfare of his serfs 
he was joyfully planning this new life when prince vas li suddenly
entered the room 

 my dear fellow what have you been up to in moscow why have you
quarreled with h l ne mon cher you are under a delusion said
prince vas li as he entered i know all about it and i can tell
you positively that h l ne is as innocent before you as christ was
before the jews 

pierre was about to reply but prince vas li interrupted him 

 and why didn t you simply come straight to me as to a friend i
know all about it and understand it all he said you behaved as
becomes a man who values his honor perhaps too hastily but we won t
go into that but consider the position in which you are placing her and
me in the eyes of society and even of the court he added lowering
his voice she is living in moscow and you are here remember 
dear boy and he drew pierre s arm downwards it is simply a
misunderstanding i expect you feel it so yourself let us write her
a letter at once and she ll come here and all will be explained or
else my dear boy let me tell you it s quite likely you ll have to
suffer for it 

prince vas li gave pierre a significant look 

 i know from reliable sources that the dowager empress is taking a
keen interest in the whole affair you know she is very gracious to
h l ne 

pierre tried several times to speak but on one hand prince vas li
did not let him and on the other pierre himself feared to begin to
speak in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he had
firmly resolved to answer his father in law moreover the words of the
masonic statutes be kindly and courteous recurred to him he
blinked went red got up and sat down again struggling with himself
to do what was for him the most difficult thing in life to say an
unpleasant thing to a man s face to say what the other whoever
he might be did not expect he was so used to submitting to prince
vas li s tone of careless self assurance that he felt he would be
unable to withstand it now but he also felt that on what he said now
his future depended whether he would follow the same old road or that
new path so attractively shown him by the masons on which he firmly
believed he would be reborn to a new life 

 now dear boy said prince vas li playfully say yes 
and i ll write to her myself and we will kill the fatted calf 

but before prince vas li had finished his playful speech pierre 
without looking at him and with a kind of fury that made him like his
father muttered in a whisper 

 prince i did not ask you here go please go and he jumped up
and opened the door for him 

 go he repeated amazed at himself and glad to see the look of
confusion and fear that showed itself on prince vas li s face 

 what s the matter with you are you ill 

 go the quivering voice repeated and prince vas li had to go
without receiving any explanation 

a week later pierre having taken leave of his new friends the masons 
and leaving large sums of money with them for alms went away to his
estates his new brethren gave him letters to the kiev and odessa masons
and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity 





chapter vi

the duel between pierre and d lokhov was hushed up and in spite of
the emperor s severity regarding duels at that time neither the
principals nor their seconds suffered for it but the story of the duel 
confirmed by pierre s rupture with his wife was the talk of society 
pierre who had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was
an illegitimate son and petted and extolled when he was the best
match in russia had sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his
marriage when the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing
to hope from him especially as he did not know how and did not
wish to court society s favor now he alone was blamed for what had
happened he was said to be insanely jealous and subject like his
father to fits of bloodthirsty rage and when after pierre s
departure h l ne returned to petersburg she was received by all her
acquaintances not only cordially but even with a shade of deference
due to her misfortune when conversation turned on her husband h l ne
assumed a dignified expression which with characteristic tact she had
acquired though she did not understand its significance this expression
suggested that she had resolved to endure her troubles uncomplainingly
and that her husband was a cross laid upon her by god prince vas li
expressed his opinion more openly he shrugged his shoulders when pierre
was mentioned and pointing to his forehead remarked 

 a bit touched i always said so 

 i said from the first declared anna p vlovna referring to
pierre i said at the time and before anyone else she insisted
on her priority that that senseless young man was spoiled by the
depraved ideas of these days i said so even at the time when everybody
was in raptures about him when he had just returned from abroad and
when if you remember he posed as a sort of marat at one of my soirees 
and how has it ended i was against this marriage even then and foretold
all that has happened 

anna p vlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of
soirees as before such as she alone had the gift of arranging at
which was to be found the cream of really good society the bloom
of the intellectual essence of petersburg as she herself put it 
besides this refined selection of society anna p vlovna s receptions
were also distinguished by the fact that she always presented some new
and interesting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was the
state of the political thermometer of legitimate petersburg court
society so dearly and distinctly indicated 

toward the end of 1806 when all the sad details of napoleon s
destruction of the prussian army at jena and auerst dt and the
surrender of most of the prussian fortresses had been received when our
troops had already entered prussia and our second war with napoleon
was beginning anna p vlovna gave one of her soirees the cream of
really good society consisted of the fascinating h l ne forsaken
by her husband mortemart the delightful prince hippolyte who had
just returned from vienna two diplomatists the old aunt a young man
referred to in that drawing room as a man of great merit un homme
de beaucoup de m rite a newly appointed maid of honor and her mother 
and several other less noteworthy persons 

the novelty anna p vlovna was setting before her guests that evening
was bor s drubetsk y who had just arrived as a special messenger from
the prussian army and was aide de camp to a very important personage 

the temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company that
evening was this 

 whatever the european sovereigns and commanders may do to
countenance bonaparte and to cause me and us in general annoyance and
mortification our opinion of bonaparte cannot alter we shall not cease
to express our sincere views on that subject and can only say to the
king of prussia and others so much the worse for you tu l as
voulu george dandin that s all we have to say about it 

when bor s who was to be served up to the guests entered the drawing
room almost all the company had assembled and the conversation guided
by anna p vlovna was about our diplomatic relations with austria and
the hope of an alliance with her 

bor s grown more manly and looking fresh rosy and self possessed 
entered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an
aide de camp and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt and
then brought back to the general circle 

anna p vlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him to
several persons whom he did not know giving him a whispered description
of each 

 prince hippolyte kur gin charming young fellow m 
kronq charg d affaires from copenhagen a profound intellect 
and simply mr sh tov a man of great merit this of the man
usually so described 

thanks to anna mikh ylovna s efforts his own tastes and the
peculiarities of his reserved nature bor s had managed during his
service to place himself very advantageously he was aide de camp to a
very important personage had been sent on a very important mission to
prussia and had just returned from there as a special messenger he had
become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had
been so pleased at olm tz and according to which an ensign might rank
incomparably higher than a general and according to which what was
needed for success in the service was not effort or work or courage or
perseverance but only the knowledge of how to get on with those who can
grant rewards and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of his
success and at the inability of others to understand these things 
in consequence of this discovery his whole manner of life all
his relations with old friends all his plans for his future were
completely altered he was not rich but would spend his last groat to
be better dressed than others and would rather deprive himself of many
pleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby equipage or appear
in the streets of petersburg in an old uniform he made friends with
and sought the acquaintance of only those above him in position and
who could therefore be of use to him he liked petersburg and despised
moscow the remembrance of the rost vs house and of his childish
love for nat sha was unpleasant to him and he had not once been to see
the rost vs since the day of his departure for the army to be in anna
p vlovna s drawing room he considered an important step up in the
service and he at once understood his role letting his hostess make
use of whatever interest he had to offer he himself carefully scanned
each face appraising the possibilities of establishing intimacy with
each of those present and the advantages that might accrue he took
the seat indicated to him beside the fair h l ne and listened to the
general conversation 

 vienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so unattainable
that not even a continuity of most brilliant successes would secure
them and she doubts the means we have of gaining them that is the
actual phrase used by the vienna cabinet said the danish charg 
d affaires 

 the doubt is flattering said the man of profound intellect 
with a subtle smile 

 we must distinguish between the vienna cabinet and the emperor of
austria said mortemart the emperor of austria can never have
thought of such a thing it is only the cabinet that says it 

 ah my dear vicomte put in anna p vlovna l urope for
some reason she called it urope as if that were a specially refined
french pronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing with
a frenchman l urope ne sera jamais notre alli e sinc re 

 europe will never be our sincere ally 


after that anna p vlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the king
of prussia in order to draw bor s into the conversation 

bor s listened attentively to each of the speakers awaiting his turn 
but managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his neighbor the
beautiful h l ne whose eyes several times met those of the handsome
young aide de camp with a smile 

speaking of the position of prussia anna p vlovna very naturally asked
bor s to tell them about his journey to glogau and in what state he
found the prussian army bor s speaking with deliberation told them
in pure correct french many interesting details about the armies and
the court carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of his
own about the facts he was recounting for some time he engrossed the
general attention and anna p vlovna felt that the novelty she had
served up was received with pleasure by all her visitors the greatest
attention of all to bor s narrative was shown by h l ne she asked
him several questions about his journey and seemed greatly interested in
the state of the prussian army as soon as he had finished she turned to
him with her usual smile 

 you absolutely must come and see me she said in a tone that
implied that for certain considerations he could not know of this was
absolutely necessary 

 on tuesday between eight and nine it will give me great pleasure 

bor s promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a
conversation with her when anna p vlovna called him away on the
pretext that her aunt wished to hear him 

 you know her husband of course said anna p vlovna closing her
eyes and indicating h l ne with a sorrowful gesture ah she is
such an unfortunate and charming woman don t mention him before
her please don t it is too painful for her 





chapter vii

when bor s and anna p vlovna returned to the others prince hippolyte
had the ear of the company 

bending forward in his armchair he said le roi de prusse and
having said this laughed everyone turned toward him 

 le roi de prusse hippolyte said interrogatively again laughing 
and then calmly and seriously sat back in his chair anna p vlovna
waited for him to go on but as he seemed quite decided to say no more
she began to tell of how at potsdam the impious bonaparte had stolen the
sword of frederick the great 

 it is the sword of frederick the great which i she began but
hippolyte interrupted her with the words le roi de prusse and
again as soon as all turned toward him excused himself and said no
more 

anna p vlovna frowned mortemart hippolyte s friend addressed him
firmly 

 come now what about your roi de prusse 

hippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughing 

 oh it s nothing i only wished to say he wanted to repeat
a joke he had heard in vienna and which he had been trying all that
evening to get in i only wished to say that we are wrong to fight
pour le roi de prusse 

bor s smiled circumspectly so that it might be taken as ironical
or appreciative according to the way the joke was received everybody
laughed 

 your joke is too bad it s witty but unjust said anna
p vlovna shaking her little shriveled finger at him 

 we are not fighting pour le roi de prusse but for right principles 
oh that wicked prince hippolyte she said 

the conversation did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on the
political news it became particularly animated toward the end of the
evening when the rewards bestowed by the emperor were mentioned 

 you know n n received a snuffbox with the portrait last
year said the man of profound intellect why shouldn t
s s get the same distinction 

 pardon me a snuffbox with the emperor s portrait is a reward but
not a distinction said the diplomatist a gift rather 

 there are precedents i may mention schwarzenberg 

 it s impossible replied another 

 will you bet the ribbon of the order is a different matter 

when everybody rose to go h l ne who had spoken very little all
the evening again turned to bor s asking him in a tone of caressing
significant command to come to her on tuesday 

 it is of great importance to me she said turning with a smile
toward anna p vlovna and anna p vlovna with the same sad smile with
which she spoke of her exalted patroness supported h l ne s wish 

it seemed as if from some words bor s had spoken that evening about the
prussian army h l ne had suddenly found it necessary to see him 
she seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he came on
tuesday 

but on tuesday evening having come to h l ne s splendid salon 
bor s received no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for
him to come there were other guests and the countess talked little to
him and only as he kissed her hand on taking leave said unexpectedly
and in a whisper with a strangely unsmiling face come to dinner
tomorrow in the evening you must come come 

during that stay in petersburg bor s became an intimate in the
countess house 





chapter viii

the war was flaming up and nearing the russian frontier everywhere one
heard curses on bonaparte the enemy of mankind militiamen and
recruits were being enrolled in the villages and from the seat of
war came contradictory news false as usual and therefore variously
interpreted the life of old prince bolk nski prince andrew and
princess mary had greatly changed since 1805 

in 1806 the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chief
then appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout russia 
despite the weakness of age which had become particularly noticeable
since the time when he thought his son had been killed he did not think
it right to refuse a duty to which he had been appointed by the emperor
himself and this fresh opportunity for action gave him new energy
and strength he was continually traveling through the three provinces
entrusted to him was pedantic in the fulfillment of his duties severe
to cruel with his subordinates and went into everything down to the
minutest details himself princess mary had ceased taking lessons in
mathematics from her father and when the old prince was at home went
to his study with the wet nurse and little prince nicholas as his
grandfather called him the baby prince nicholas lived with his wet
nurse and nurse s vishna in the late princess rooms and princess
mary spent most of the day in the nursery taking a mother s place to
her little nephew as best she could mademoiselle bourienne too seemed
passionately fond of the boy and princess mary often deprived herself
to give her friend the pleasure of dandling the little angel as she
called her nephew and playing with him 

near the altar of the church at bald hills there was a chapel over the
tomb of the little princess and in this chapel was a marble monument
brought from italy representing an angel with outspread wings ready to
fly upwards the angel s upper lip was slightly raised as though
about to smile and once on coming out of the chapel prince andrew and
princess mary admitted to one another that the angel s face reminded
them strangely of the little princess but what was still stranger 
though of this prince andrew said nothing to his sister was that in the
expression the sculptor had happened to give the angel s face prince
andrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead
wife ah why have you done this to me 

soon after prince andrew s return the old prince made over to him a
large estate boguch rovo about twenty five miles from bald hills 
partly because of the depressing memories associated with bald hills 
partly because prince andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with
his father s peculiarities and partly because he needed solitude 
prince andrew made use of boguch rovo began building and spent most of
his time there 

after the austerlitz campaign prince andrew had firmly resolved not
to continue his military service and when the war recommenced
and everybody had to serve he took a post under his father in the
recruitment so as to avoid active service the old prince and his son
seemed to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805 the old man 
roused by activity expected the best results from the new campaign 
while prince andrew on the contrary taking no part in the war and
secretly regretting this saw only the dark side 

on february 26 1807 the old prince set off on one of his circuits 
prince andrew remained at bald hills as usual during his father s
absence little nicholas had been unwell for four days the coachman who
had driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and letters
for prince andrew 

not finding the young prince in his study the valet went with the
letters to princess mary s apartments but did not find him there he
was told that the prince had gone to the nursery 

 if you please your excellency p trusha has brought some papers 
said one of the nursemaids to prince andrew who was sitting on a
child s little chair while frowning and with trembling hands he
poured drops from a medicine bottle into a wineglass half full of water 

 what is it he said crossly and his hand shaking
unintentionally he poured too many drops into the glass he threw the
mixture onto the floor and asked for some more water the maid brought
it 

there were in the room a child s cot two boxes two armchairs a
table a child s table and the little chair on which prince andrew
was sitting the curtains were drawn and a single candle was burning on
the table screened by a bound music book so that the light did not fall
on the cot 

 my dear said princess mary addressing her brother from beside
the cot where she was standing better wait a bit later 

 oh leave off you always talk nonsense and keep putting things
off and this is what comes of it said prince andrew in an
exasperated whisper evidently meaning to wound his sister 

 my dear really it s better not to wake him he s asleep 
said the princess in a tone of entreaty 

prince andrew got up and went on tiptoe up to the little bed wineglass
in hand 

 perhaps we d really better not wake him he said hesitating 

 as you please really i think so but as you please said
princess mary evidently intimidated and confused that her opinion
had prevailed she drew her brother s attention to the maid who was
calling him in a whisper 

it was the second night that neither of them had slept watching the boy
who was in a high fever these last days mistrusting their household
doctor and expecting another for whom they had sent to town they had
been trying first one remedy and then another worn out by sleeplessness
and anxiety they threw their burden of sorrow on one another and
reproached and disputed with each other 

 p trusha has come with papers from your father whispered the
maid 

prince andrew went out 

 devil take them he muttered and after listening to the verbal
instructions his father had sent and taking the correspondence and his
father s letter he returned to the nursery 

 well he asked 

 still the same wait for heaven s sake karl iv nich always says
that sleep is more important than anything whispered princess mary
with a sigh 

prince andrew went up to the child and felt him he was burning hot 

 confound you and your karl iv nich he took the glass with the
drops and again went up to the cot 

 andrew don t said princess mary 

but he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in his eyes 
and stooped glass in hand over the infant 

 but i wish it he said i beg you give it him 

princess mary shrugged her shoulders but took the glass submissively
and calling the nurse began giving the medicine the child screamed
hoarsely prince andrew winced and clutching his head went out and sat
down on a sofa in the next room 

he still had all the letters in his hand opening them mechanically he
began reading the old prince now and then using abbreviations wrote
in his large elongated hand on blue paper as follows 

have just this moment received by special messenger very joyful
news if it s not false bennigsen seems to have obtained a complete
victory over buonaparte at eylau in petersburg everyone is rejoicing 
and the rewards sent to the army are innumerable though he is a
german i congratulate him i can t make out what the commander at
k rchevo a certain khandrik v is up to till now the additional
men and provisions have not arrived gallop off to him at once and
say i ll have his head off if everything is not here in a week 
have received another letter about the preussisch eylau battle
from p tenka he took part in it and it s all true when
mischief makers don t meddle even a german beats buonaparte he is
said to be fleeing in great disorder mind you gallop off to k rchevo
without delay and carry out instructions 

prince andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope it was
a closely written letter of two sheets from bil bin he folded it up
without reading it and reread his father s letter ending with the
words gallop off to k rchevo and carry out instructions 

 no pardon me i won t go now till the child is better thought
he going to the door and looking into the nursery 

princess mary was still standing by the cot gently rocking the baby 

 ah yes and what else did he say that s unpleasant thought
prince andrew recalling his father s letter yes we have gained
a victory over bonaparte just when i m not serving yes yes he s
always poking fun at me ah well let him and he began reading
bil bin s letter which was written in french he read without
understanding half of it read only to forget if but for a moment what
he had too long been thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of all
else 





chapter ix

bil bin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity and
though he wrote in french and used french jests and french idioms 
he described the whole campaign with a fearless self censure and
self derision genuinely russian bil bin wrote that the obligation of
diplomatic discretion tormented him and he was happy to have in prince
andrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the bile he
had accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the army 
the letter was old having been written before the battle at
preussisch eylau 

 since the day of our brilliant success at austerlitz wrote
bil bin as you know my dear prince i never leave headquarters i
have certainly acquired a taste for war and it is just as well for me 
what i have seen during these last three months is incredible 

 i begin ab ovo the enemy of the human race as you know 
attacks the prussians the prussians are our faithful allies who have
only betrayed us three times in three years we take up their cause but
it turns out that the enemy of the human race pays no heed to
our fine speeches and in his rude and savage way throws himself on the
prussians without giving them time to finish the parade they had begun 
and in two twists of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installs
himself in the palace at potsdam 

 i most ardently desire writes the king of prussia to
bonaparte that your majesty should be received and treated in my
palace in a manner agreeable to yourself and in so far as circumstances
allowed i have hastened to take all steps to that end may i have
succeeded the prussian generals pride themselves on being polite to
the french and lay down their arms at the first demand 

 the head of the garrison at glogau with ten thousand men asks the
king of prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender all
this is absolutely true 

 in short hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude 
it turns out that we have landed ourselves in war and what is more 
in war on our own frontiers with and for the king of prussia we have
everything in perfect order only one little thing is lacking namely 
a commander in chief as it was considered that the austerlitz success
might have been more decisive had the commander in chief not been so
young all our octogenarians were reviewed and of prozor vski
and k menski the latter was preferred the general comes to us 
suv rov like in a kib tka and is received with acclamations of joy
and triumph 

 on the 4th the first courier arrives from petersburg the mails
are taken to the field marshal s room for he likes to do everything
himself i am called in to help sort the letters and take those meant
for us the field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressed
to him we search but none are to be found the field marshal grows
impatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the emperor
to count t prince v and others then he bursts into one of his wild
furies and rages at everyone and everything seizes the letters opens
them and reads those from the emperor addressed to others ah so
that s the way they treat me no confidence in me ah ordered to keep
an eye on me very well then get along with you so he writes the
famous order of the day to general bennigsen 

 i am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the
army you have brought your army corps to pult sk routed here it is
exposed and without fuel or forage so something must be done and as
you yourself reported to count buxh wden yesterday you must think of
retreating to our frontier which do today 

 from all my riding he writes to the emperor i have got a
saddle sore which coming after all my previous journeys quite prevents
my riding and commanding so vast an army so i have passed on the
command to the general next in seniority count buxh wden having sent
him my whole staff and all that belongs to it advising him if there is
a lack of bread to move farther into the interior of prussia for only
one day s ration of bread remains and in some regiments none at all 
as reported by the division commanders ostermann and sedmor tzki and
all that the peasants had has been eaten up i myself will remain in
hospital at ostrolenka till i recover in regard to which i humbly
submit my report with the information that if the army remains in its
present bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy man left
in it by spring 

 grant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is
already in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and
glorious task for which he was chosen i shall await your most gracious
permission here in hospital that i may not have to play the part of a
secretary rather than commander in the army my removal from the army
does not produce the slightest stir a blind man has left it there are
thousands such as i in russia 

 the field marshal is angry with the emperor and he punishes us all 
isn t it logical 

 this is the first act those that follow are naturally increasingly
interesting and entertaining after the field marshal s departure
it appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle 
buxh wden is commander in chief by seniority but general bennigsen
does not quite see it more particularly as it is he and his corps who
are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity
to fight a battle on his own hand as the germans say he does so 
this is the battle of pult sk which is considered a great victory but
in my opinion was nothing of the kind we civilians as you know have
a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost those who
retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say and according to
that it is we who lost the battle of pult sk in short we retreat
after the battle but send a courier to petersburg with news of a
victory and general bennigsen hoping to receive from petersburg the
post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory does not give up
the command of the army to general buxh wden during this interregnum
we begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers our aim is
no longer as it should be to avoid or attack the enemy but solely to
avoid general buxh wden who by right of seniority should be our chief 
so energetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordable
river we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy who at
the moment is not bonaparte but buxh wden general buxh wden was all
but attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one
of these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him buxh wden pursues
us we scuttle he hardly crosses the river to our side before we
recross to the other at last our enemy buxh wden catches us and
attacks both generals are angry and the result is a challenge on
buxh wden s part and an epileptic fit on bennigsen s but at the
critical moment the courier who carried the news of our victory at
pult sk to petersburg returns bringing our appointment as commander in
chief and our first foe buxh wden is vanquished we can now turn
our thoughts to the second bonaparte but as it turns out just at
that moment a third enemy rises before us namely the orthodox russian
soldiers loudly demanding bread meat biscuits fodder and whatnot 
the stores are empty the roads impassable the orthodox begin looting 
and in a way of which our last campaign can give you no idea half the
regiments form bands and scour the countryside and put everything
to fire and sword the inhabitants are totally ruined the hospitals
overflow with sick and famine is everywhere twice the marauders even
attack our headquarters and the commander in chief has to ask for a
battalion to disperse them during one of these attacks they carried off
my empty portmanteau and my dressing gown the emperor proposes to give
all commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders but i much
fear this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other 

at first prince andrew read with his eyes only but after a while 
in spite of himself although he knew how far it was safe to trust
bil bin what he had read began to interest him more and more when he
had read thus far he crumpled the letter up and threw it away it was
not what he had read that vexed him but the fact that the life out
there in which he had now no part could perturb him he shut his eyes 
rubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he
had read and listened to what was passing in the nursery suddenly he
thought he heard a strange noise through the door he was seized with
alarm lest something should have happened to the child while he was
reading the letter he went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened it 

just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him
with a scared look and that princess mary was no longer by the cot 

 my dear he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind
him 

as often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety he was
seized by an unreasoning panic it occurred to him that the child was
dead all that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror 

 all is over he thought and a cold sweat broke out on his
forehead he went to the cot in confusion sure that he would find it
empty and that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby he drew the
curtain aside and for some time his frightened restless eyes could not
find the baby at last he saw him the rosy boy had tossed about till he
lay across the bed with his head lower than the pillow and was smacking
his lips in his sleep and breathing evenly 

prince andrew was as glad to find the boy like that as if he had
already lost him he bent over him and as his sister had taught him 
tried with his lips whether the child was still feverish the soft
forehead was moist prince andrew touched the head with his hand even
the hair was wet so profusely had the child perspired he was not dead 
but evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent prince andrew
longed to snatch up to squeeze to hold to his heart this helpless
little creature but dared not do so he stood over him gazing at his
head and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket he
heard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of
the cot he did not look round but still gazing at the infant s face
listened to his regular breathing the dark shadow was princess mary 
who had come up to the cot with noiseless steps lifted the curtain 
and dropped it again behind her prince andrew recognized her without
looking and held out his hand to her she pressed it 

 he has perspired said prince andrew 

 i was coming to tell you so 

the child moved slightly in his sleep smiled and rubbed his forehead
against the pillow 

prince andrew looked at his sister in the dim shadow of the curtain her
luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy that
were in them she leaned over to her brother and kissed him slightly
catching the curtain of the cot each made the other a warning gesture
and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishing
to leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all the
world prince andrew was the first to move away ruffling his hair
against the muslin of the curtain 

 yes this is the one thing left me now he said with a sigh 





chapter x

soon after his admission to the masonic brotherhood pierre went to the
kiev province where he had the greatest number of serfs taking with
him full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to
what he should do on his estates 

when he reached kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office
and explained to them his intentions and wishes he told them that steps
would be taken immediately to free his serfs and that till then they
were not to be overburdened with labor women while nursing their babies
were not to be sent to work assistance was to be given to the serfs 
punishments were to be admonitory and not corporal and hospitals 
asylums and schools were to be established on all the estates some of
the stewards there were semiliterate foremen among them listened with
alarm supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeased
with their management and embezzlement of money some after their first
fright were amused by pierre s lisp and the new words they had not
heard before others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked while
the cleverest among them including the chief steward understood from
this speech how they could best handle the master for their own ends 

the chief steward expressed great sympathy with pierre s intentions 
but remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go into
the general state of affairs which was far from satisfactory 

despite count bez khov s enormous wealth since he had come into an
income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year 
pierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him
an allowance of ten thousand rubles he had a dim perception of the
following budget 

about 80 000 went in payments on all the estates to the land bank about
30 000 went for the upkeep of the estate near moscow the town house 
and the allowance to the three princesses about 15 000 was given in
pensions and the same amount for asylums 150 000 alimony was sent to
the countess about 70 000 went for interest on debts the building of a
new church previously begun had cost about 10 000 in each of the last
two years and he did not know how the rest about 100 000 rubles was
spent and almost every year he was obliged to borrow besides this the
chief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests 
or of the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops so the first
task pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude or
inclination practical business 

he discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward but
he felt that this did not forward matters at all he felt that these
consultations were detached from real affairs and did not link up with
them or make them move on the one hand the chief steward put the state
of things to him in the very worst light pointing out the necessity of
paying off the debts and undertaking new activities with serf labor 
to which pierre did not agree on the other hand pierre demanded that
steps should be taken to liberate the serfs which the steward met by
showing the necessity of first paying off the loans from the land bank 
and the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipation 

the steward did not say it was quite impossible but suggested selling
the forests in the province of kostrom the land lower down the river 
and the crimean estate in order to make it possible all of which
operations according to him were connected with such complicated
measures the removal of injunctions petitions permits and so
on that pierre became quite bewildered and only replied 

 yes yes do so 

pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him
to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only tried
to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it the steward
for his part tried to pretend to the count that he considered these
consultations very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome to
himself 

in kiev pierre found some people he knew and strangers hastened to make
his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer the
largest landowner of the province temptations to pierre s greatest
weakness the one to which he had confessed when admitted to the
lodge were so strong that he could not resist them again whole days 
weeks and months of his life passed in as great a rush and were as much
occupied with evening parties dinners lunches and balls giving him
no time for reflection as in petersburg instead of the new life he had
hoped to lead he still lived the old life only in new surroundings 

of the three precepts of freemasonry pierre realized that he did not
fulfill the one which enjoined every mason to set an example of moral
life and that of the seven virtues he lacked two morality and the
love of death he consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled
another of the precepts that of reforming the human race and had
other virtues love of his neighbor and especially generosity 

in the spring of 1807 he decided to return to petersburg on the way he
intended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his orders
had been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom god had
entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit 

the chief steward who considered the young count s attempts almost
insane unprofitable to himself to the count and to the serfs made
some concessions continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs
as impracticable he arranged for the erection of large
buildings schools hospitals and asylums on all the estates
before the master arrived everywhere preparations were made not for
ceremonious welcomes which he knew pierre would not like but for just
such gratefully religious ones with offerings of icons and the bread
and salt of hospitality as according to his understanding of his
master would touch and delude him 

the southern spring the comfortable rapid traveling in a vienna
carriage and the solitude of the road all had a gladdening effect on
pierre the estates he had not before visited were each more picturesque
than the other the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly
grateful for the benefits conferred on them everywhere were receptions 
which though they embarrassed pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the
depth of his heart in one place the peasants presented him with bread
and salt and an icon of saint peter and saint paul asking permission 
as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them 
to build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor
of peter and paul his patron saints in another place the women with
infants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard
work on a third estate the priest bearing a cross came to meet
him surrounded by children whom by the count s generosity he was
instructing in reading writing and religion on all his estates pierre
saw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erection 
all on one plan for hospitals schools and almshouses which were soon
to be opened everywhere he saw the stewards accounts according to
which the serfs manorial labor had been diminished and heard the
touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their full skirted blue
coats 

what pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him
with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of peter and
paul was a market village where a fair was held on st peter s day 
and that the richest peasants who formed the deputation had begun
the chantry long before but that nine tenths of the peasants in that
villages were in a state of the greatest poverty he did not know that
since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land they
did still harder work on their own land he did not know that the priest
who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions and
that the pupils parents wept at having to let him take their children
and secured their release by heavy payments he did not know that the
brick buildings built to plan were being built by serfs whose manorial
labor was thus increased though lessened on paper he did not know
that where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs 
payments had been diminished by a third their obligatory manorial work
had been increased by a half and so pierre was delighted with his visit
to his estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which
he had left petersburg and wrote enthusiastic letters to his
 brother instructor as he called the grand master 

 how easy it is how little effort it needs to do so much good 
thought pierre and how little attention we pay to it 

he was pleased at the gratitude he received but felt abashed at
receiving it this gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do
for these simple kindly people 

the chief steward a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly
through the na ve and intelligent count and played with him as with
a toy seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on pierre 
pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all
the uselessness of freeing the serfs who were quite happy as it was 

pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be
difficult to imagine happier people and that god only knew what would
happen to them when they were free but he insisted though reluctantly 
on what he thought right the steward promised to do all in his power to
carry out the count s wishes seeing clearly that not only would the
count never be able to find out whether all measures had been taken for
the sale of the land and forests and to release them from the land bank 
but would probably never even inquire and would never know that the
newly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continued
to give in money and work all that other people s serfs gave that is
to say all that could be got out of them 





chapter xi

returning from his journey through south russia in the happiest state
of mind pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting his
friend bolk nski whom he had not seen for two years 

boguch rovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among
fields and forests of fir and birch which were partly cut down the
house lay behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and
with banks still bare of grass it was at the end of a village that
stretched along the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which were
a few fir trees 

the homestead consisted of a threshing floor outhouses stables a
bathhouse a lodge and a large brick house with semicircular fa ade
still in course of construction round the house was a garden newly laid
out the fences and gates were new and solid two fire pumps and a
water cart painted green stood in a shed the paths were straight 
the bridges were strong and had handrails everything bore an impress of
tidiness and good management some domestic serfs pierre met in reply
to inquiries as to where the prince lived pointed out a small newly
built lodge close to the pond ant n a man who had looked after prince
andrew in his boyhood helped pierre out of his carriage said that the
prince was at home and showed him into a clean little anteroom 

pierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house after
the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend in
petersburg 

he quickly entered the small reception room with its still unplastered
wooden walls redolent of pine and would have gone farther but ant n
ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door 

 well what is it came a sharp unpleasant voice 

 a visitor answered ant n 

 ask him to wait and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed
back 

pierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to
face with prince andrew who came out frowning and looking old pierre
embraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek
and looked at him closely 

 well i did not expect you i am very glad said prince andrew 

pierre said nothing he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise he
was struck by the change in him his words were kindly and there was a
smile on his lips and face but his eyes were dull and lifeless and in
spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous
and glad sparkle prince andrew had grown thinner paler and more
manly looking but what amazed and estranged pierre till he got used
to it were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged
concentration on some one thought 

as is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation 
it was long before their conversation could settle on anything they
put questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to
be talked over at length at last the conversation gradually settled on
some of the topics at first lightly touched on their past life plans
for the future pierre s journeys and occupations the war and so
on the preoccupation and despondency which pierre had noticed in his
friend s look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile
with which he listened to pierre especially when he spoke with joyful
animation of the past or the future it was as if prince andrew would
have liked to sympathize with what pierre was saying but could not 
the latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his
enthusiasms dreams and hopes of happiness or goodness in prince
andrew s presence he was ashamed to express his new masonic views 
which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour 
he checked himself fearing to seem na ve yet he felt an irresistible
desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite
different and better pierre than he had been in petersburg 

 i can t tell you how much i have lived through since then i hardly
know myself again 

 yes we have altered much very much since then said prince
andrew 

 well and you what are your plans 

 plans repeated prince andrew ironically my plans he said 
as if astonished at the word well you see i m building i mean
to settle here altogether next year 

pierre looked silently and searchingly into prince andrew s face 
which had grown much older 

 no i meant to ask pierre began but prince andrew interrupted
him 

 but why talk of me talk to me yes tell me about your travels
and all you have been doing on your estates 

pierre began describing what he had done on his estates trying as far
as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been
made prince andrew several times prompted pierre s story of what he
had been doing as though it were all an old time story and he listened
not only without interest but even as if ashamed of what pierre was
telling him 

pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friend s company
and at last became silent 

 i ll tell you what my dear fellow said prince andrew who
evidently also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor i am
only bivouacking here and have just come to look round i am going back
to my sister today i will introduce you to her but of course you know
her already he said evidently trying to entertain a visitor with
whom he now found nothing in common we will go after dinner and
would you now like to look round my place 

they went out and walked about till dinnertime talking of the political
news and common acquaintances like people who do not know each other
intimately prince andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of
the new homestead he was constructing and its buildings but even here 
while on the scaffolding in the midst of a talk explaining the future
arrangements of the house he interrupted himself 

 however this is not at all interesting let us have dinner and then
we ll set off 

at dinner conversation turned on pierre s marriage 

 i was very much surprised when i heard of it said prince andrew 

pierre blushed as he always did when it was mentioned and said
hurriedly i will tell you some time how it all happened but you
know it is all over and forever 

 forever said prince andrew nothing s forever 

 but you know how it all ended don t you you heard of the duel 

 and so you had to go through that too 

 one thing i thank god for is that i did not kill that man said
pierre 

 why so asked prince andrew to kill a vicious dog is a very
good thing really 

 no to kill a man is bad wrong 

 why is it wrong urged prince andrew it is not given to man
to know what is right and what is wrong men always did and always will
err and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong 

 what does harm to another is wrong said pierre feeling with
pleasure that for the first time since his arrival prince andrew was
roused had begun to talk and wanted to express what had brought him to
his present state 

 and who has told you what is bad for another man he asked 

 bad bad exclaimed pierre we all know what is bad for
ourselves 

 yes we know that but the harm i am conscious of in myself is
something i cannot inflict on others said prince andrew growing
more and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook
to pierre he spoke in french i only know two very real evils in
life remorse and illness the only good is the absence of those evils 
to live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy
now 

 and love of one s neighbor and self sacrifice began pierre 
 no i can t agree with you to live only so as not to do evil and
not to have to repent is not enough i lived like that i lived for
myself and ruined my life and only now when i am living or at least
trying pierre s modesty made him correct himself to live for
others only now have i understood all the happiness of life no i
shall not agree with you and you do not really believe what you are
saying prince andrew looked silently at pierre with an ironic smile 

 when you see my sister princess mary you ll get on with her 
he said perhaps you are right for yourself he added after
a short pause but everyone lives in his own way you lived for
yourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness
when you began living for others i experienced just the reverse i
lived for glory and after all what is glory the same love of others 
a desire to do something for them a desire for their approval so i
lived for others and not almost but quite ruined my life and i have
become calmer since i began to live only for myself 

 but what do you mean by living only for yourself asked pierre 
growing excited what about your son your sister and your
father 

 but that s just the same as myself they are not others 
explained prince andrew the others one s neighbors le prochain 
as you and princess mary call it are the chief source of all error and
evil le prochain your kiev peasants to whom you want to do good 

and he looked at pierre with a mocking challenging expression he
evidently wished to draw him on 

 you are joking replied pierre growing more and more excited 
 what error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good and even
doing a little though i did very little and did it very badly what
evil can there be in it if unfortunate people our serfs people like
ourselves were growing up and dying with no idea of god and truth
beyond ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed in
a comforting belief in future life retribution recompense and
consolation what evil and error are there in it if people were dying
of disease without help while material assistance could so easily be
rendered and i supplied them with a doctor a hospital and an asylum
for the aged and is it not a palpable unquestionable good if a
peasant or a woman with a baby has no rest day or night and i give
them rest and leisure said pierre hurrying and lisping and
i have done that though badly and to a small extent but i have done
something toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good
action and more than that you can t make me believe that you do not
think so yourself and the main thing is he continued that i
know and know for certain that the enjoyment of doing this good is the
only sure happiness in life 

 yes if you put it like that it s quite a different matter said
prince andrew i build a house and lay out a garden and you build
hospitals the one and the other may serve as a pastime but what s
right and what s good must be judged by one who knows all but not by
us well you want an argument he added come on then 

they rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served
as a veranda 

 come let s argue then said prince andrew you talk of
schools he went on crooking a finger education and so forth 
that is you want to raise him pointing to a peasant who passed by
them taking off his cap from his animal condition and awaken in him
spiritual needs while it seems to me that animal happiness is the only
happiness possible and that is just what you want to deprive him of 
i envy him but you want to make him what i am without giving him my
means then you say lighten his toil but as i see it physical
labor is as essential to him as much a condition of his existence as
mental activity is to you or me you can t help thinking i go to bed
after two in the morning thoughts come and i can t sleep but toss
about till dawn because i think and can t help thinking just as
he can t help plowing and mowing if he didn t he would go to the
drink shop or fall ill just as i could not stand his terrible physical
labor but should die of it in a week so he could not stand my physical
idleness but would grow fat and die the third thing what else was
it you talked about and prince andrew crooked a third finger ah 
yes hospitals medicine he has a fit he is dying and you come and
bleed him and patch him up he will drag about as a cripple a burden to
everybody for another ten years it would be far easier and simpler for
him to die others are being born and there are plenty of them as it is 
it would be different if you grudged losing a laborer that s how i
regard him but you want to cure him from love of him and he does not
want that and besides what a notion that medicine ever cured anyone 
killed them yes said he frowning angrily and turning away from
pierre 

prince andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it was
evident he had reflected on this subject more than once and he spoke
readily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time his
glance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopeless 

 oh that is dreadful dreadful said pierre i don t
understand how one can live with such ideas i had such moments
myself not long ago in moscow and when traveling but at such times i
collapsed so that i don t live at all everything seems hateful to
me myself most of all then i don t eat don t wash and how is
it with you 

 why not wash that is not cleanly said prince andrew on the
contrary one must try to make one s life as pleasant as possible 
i m alive that is not my fault so i must live out my life as best i
can without hurting others 

 but with such ideas what motive have you for living one would sit
without moving undertaking nothing 

 life as it is leaves one no peace i should be thankful to do
nothing but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the
honor to choose me to be their marshal it was all i could do to get
out of it they could not understand that i have not the necessary
qualifications for it the kind of good natured fussy shallowness
necessary for the position then there s this house which must be
built in order to have a nook of one s own in which to be quiet and
now there s this recruiting 

 why aren t you serving in the army 

 after austerlitz said prince andrew gloomily no thank you
very much i have promised myself not to serve again in the active
russian army and i won t not even if bonaparte were here at
smol nsk threatening bald hills even then i wouldn t serve in the
russian army well as i was saying he continued recovering his
composure now there s this recruiting my father is chief in
command of the third district and my only way of avoiding active
service is to serve under him 

 then you are serving 

 i am 

he paused a little while 

 and why do you serve 

 why for this reason my father is one of the most remarkable men of
his time but he is growing old and though not exactly cruel he has too
energetic a character he is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is
terrible and now he has this authority of a commander in chief of
the recruiting granted by the emperor if i had been two hours late
a fortnight ago he would have had a paymaster s clerk at y khnovna
hanged said prince andrew with a smile so i am serving because
i alone have any influence with my father and now and then can save him
from actions which would torment him afterwards 

 well there you see 

 yes but it is not as you imagine prince andrew continued i
did not and do not in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk
who had stolen some boots from the recruits i should even have been
very glad to see him hanged but i was sorry for my father that again
is for myself 

prince andrew grew more and more animated his eyes glittered feverishly
while he tried to prove to pierre that in his actions there was no
desire to do good to his neighbor 

 there now you wish to liberate your serfs he continued that
is a very good thing but not for you i don t suppose you ever had
anyone flogged or sent to siberia and still less for your serfs if
they are beaten flogged or sent to siberia i don t suppose they are
any the worse off in siberia they lead the same animal life and the
stripes on their bodies heal and they are happy as before but it is
a good thing for proprietors who perish morally bring remorse upon
themselves stifle this remorse and grow callous as a result of being
able to inflict punishments justly and unjustly it is those people i
pity and for their sake i should like to liberate the serfs you
may not have seen but i have seen how good men brought up in those
traditions of unlimited power in time when they grow more irritable 
become cruel and harsh are conscious of it but cannot restrain
themselves and grow more and more miserable 

prince andrew spoke so earnestly that pierre could not help thinking
that these thoughts had been suggested to prince andrew by his
father s case 

he did not reply 

 so that s what i m sorry for human dignity peace of mind 
purity and not the serfs backs and foreheads which beat and shave
as you may always remain the same backs and foreheads 

 no no a thousand times no i shall never agree with you said
pierre 





chapter xii

in the evening andrew and pierre got into the open carriage and drove to
bald hills prince andrew glancing at pierre broke the silence now and
then with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper 

pointing to the fields he spoke of the improvements he was making in
his husbandry 

pierre remained gloomily silent answering in monosyllables and
apparently immersed in his own thoughts 

he was thinking that prince andrew was unhappy had gone astray did not
see the true light and that he pierre ought to aid enlighten and
raise him but as soon as he thought of what he should say he felt that
prince andrew with one word one argument would upset all his teaching 
and he shrank from beginning afraid of exposing to possible ridicule
what to him was precious and sacred 

 no but why do you think so pierre suddenly began lowering his
head and looking like a bull about to charge why do you think so 
you should not think so 

 think what about asked prince andrew with surprise 

 about life about man s destiny it can t be so i myself thought
like that and do you know what saved me freemasonry no don t
smile freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect as i thought
it was freemasonry is the best expression of the best the eternal 
aspects of humanity 

and he began to explain freemasonry as he understood it to prince
andrew he said that freemasonry is the teaching of christianity freed
from the bonds of state and church a teaching of equality brotherhood 
and love 

 only our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life all the rest
is a dream said pierre understand my dear fellow that outside
this union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and i agree with you
that nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out
his life like you merely trying not to harm others but make our
fundamental convictions your own join our brotherhood give yourself up
to us let yourself be guided and you will at once feel yourself as i
have felt myself a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning of
which is hidden in heaven said pierre 

prince andrew looking straight in front of him listened in silence to
pierre s words more than once when the noise of the wheels prevented
his catching what pierre said he asked him to repeat it and by the
peculiar glow that came into prince andrew s eyes and by his silence 
pierre saw that his words were not in vain and that prince andrew would
not interrupt him or laugh at what he said 

they reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had to
cross by ferry while the carriage and horses were being placed on it 
they also stepped on the raft 

prince andrew leaning his arms on the raft railing gazed silently at
the flooding waters glittering in the setting sun 

 well what do you think about it pierre asked why are you
silent 

 what do i think about it i am listening to you it s all very
well you say join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of
life the destiny of man and the laws which govern the world but who
are we men how is it you know everything why do i alone not see what
you see you see a reign of goodness and truth on earth but i don t
see it 

pierre interrupted him 

 do you believe in a future life he asked 

 a future life prince andrew repeated but pierre giving him no
time to reply took the repetition for a denial the more readily as he
knew prince andrew s former atheistic convictions 

 you say you can t see a reign of goodness and truth on earth nor
could i and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the end
of everything on earth here on this earth pierre pointed to
the fields there is no truth all is false and evil but in the
universe in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth and we who
are now the children of earth are eternally children of the
whole universe don t i feel in my soul that i am part of this vast
harmonious whole don t i feel that i form one link one step between
the lower and higher beings in this vast harmonious multitude of
beings in whom the deity the supreme power if you prefer the term is
manifest if i see clearly see that ladder leading from plant to man 
why should i suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and
farther i feel that i cannot vanish since nothing vanishes in this
world but that i shall always exist and always have existed i feel
that beyond me and above me there are spirits and that in this world
there is truth 

 yes that is herder s theory said prince andrew but it is
not that which can convince me dear friend life and death are what
convince what convinces is when one sees a being dear to one bound
up with one s own life before whom one was to blame and had hoped to
make it right prince andrew s voice trembled and he turned away 
 and suddenly that being is seized with pain suffers and ceases to
exist why it cannot be that there is no answer and i believe there
is that s what convinces that is what has convinced me said
prince andrew 

 yes yes of course said pierre isn t that what i m
saying 

 no all i say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the
necessity of a future life but this when you go hand in hand with
someone and all at once that person vanishes there into nowhere and
you yourself are left facing that abyss and look in and i have looked
in 

 well that s it then you know that there is a there and there is a
someone there is the future life the someone is god 

prince andrew did not reply the carriage and horses had long since been
taken off onto the farther bank and reharnessed the sun had sunk half
below the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles near
the ferry but pierre and andrew to the astonishment of the footmen 
coachmen and ferrymen still stood on the raft and talked 

 if there is a god and future life there is truth and good and
man s highest happiness consists in striving to attain them we must
live we must love and we must believe that we live not only today on
this scrap of earth but have lived and shall live forever there in
the whole said pierre and he pointed to the sky 

prince andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to
pierre and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of the
sun gleaming on the blue waters there was perfect stillness pierre
became silent the raft had long since stopped and only the waves of the
current beat softly against it below prince andrew felt as if the sound
of the waves kept up a refrain to pierre s words whispering 

 it is true believe it 

he sighed and glanced with a radiant childlike tender look at
pierre s face flushed and rapturous but yet shy before his superior
friend 

 yes if it only were so said prince andrew however it is
time to get on he added and stepping off the raft he looked up
at the sky to which pierre had pointed and for the first time since
austerlitz saw that high everlasting sky he had seen while lying on
that battlefield and something that had long been slumbering something
that was best within him suddenly awoke joyful and youthful in his
soul it vanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditions
of his life but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to
develop existed within him his meeting with pierre formed an epoch in
prince andrew s life though outwardly he continued to live in the
same old way inwardly he began a new life 





chapter xiii

it was getting dusk when prince andrew and pierre drove up to the front
entrance of the house at bald hills as they approached the house 
prince andrew with a smile drew pierre s attention to a commotion
going on at the back porch a woman bent with age with a wallet on her
back and a short long haired young man in a black garment had rushed
back to the gate on seeing the carriage driving up two women ran out
after them and all four looking round at the carriage ran in dismay
up the steps of the back porch 

 those are mary s god s folk said prince andrew they
have mistaken us for my father this is the one matter in which she
disobeys him he orders these pilgrims to be driven away but she
receives them 

 but what are god s folk asked pierre 

prince andrew had no time to answer the servants came out to meet them 
and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected back
soon 

the old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minute 

prince andrew led pierre to his own apartments which were always kept
in perfect order and readiness for him in his father s house he
himself went to the nursery 

 let us go and see my sister he said to pierre when he returned 
 i have not found her yet she is hiding now sitting with her
 god s folk it will serve her right she will be confused but
you will see her god s folk it s really very curious 

 what are god s folk asked pierre 

 come and you ll see for yourself 

princess mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her face
when they went in in her snug room with lamps burning before the icon
stand a young lad with a long nose and long hair wearing a monk s
cassock sat on the sofa beside her behind a samovar near them in an
armchair sat a thin shriveled old woman with a meek expression on
her childlike face 

 andrew why didn t you warn me said the princess with mild
reproach as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her
chickens 

 charm e de vous voir je suis tr s contente de vous voir she
said to pierre as he kissed her hand she had known him as a child and
now his friendship with andrew his misfortune with his wife and above
all his kindly simple face disposed her favorably toward him she
looked at him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say i
like you very much but please don t laugh at my people after
exchanging the first greetings they sat down 

 delighted to see you i am very glad to see you 


 ah and iv nushka is here too said prince andrew glancing with
a smile at the young pilgrim 

 andrew said princess mary imploringly il faut que vous
sachiez que c est une femme said prince andrew to pierre 

 andrew au nom de dieu 2 princess mary repeated 

 you must know that this is a woman 

 2 for heaven s sake 


it was evident that prince andrew s ironical tone toward the pilgrims
and princess mary s helpless attempts to protect them were their
customary long established relations on the matter 

 mais ma bonne amie said prince andrew vous devriez au
contraire m tre reconnaissante de ce que j explique pierre
votre intimit avec ce jeune homme 

 but my dear you ought on the contrary to be grateful to
 me for explaining to pierre your intimacy with this young
 man 


 really said pierre gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and
seriousness for which princess mary was specially grateful to him into
iv nushka s face who seeing that she was being spoken about looked
round at them all with crafty eyes 

princess mary s embarrassment on her people s account was quite
unnecessary they were not in the least abashed the old woman lowering
her eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers had turned her cup
upside down and placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside it and sat
quietly in her armchair though hoping to be offered another cup of tea 
iv nushka sipping out of her saucer looked with sly womanish eyes
from under her brows at the young men 

 where have you been to kiev prince andrew asked the old woman 

 i have good sir she answered garrulously just at
christmastime i was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly
sacrament at the shrine of the saint and now i m from koly zin 
master where a great and wonderful blessing has been revealed 

 and was iv nushka with you 

 i go by myself benefactor said iv nushka trying to speak in a
bass voice i only came across pelag ya in y khnovo 

pelag ya interrupted her companion she evidently wished to tell what
she had seen 

 in koly zin master a wonderful blessing has been revealed 

 what is it some new relics asked prince andrew 

 andrew do leave off said princess mary don t tell him 
pelag ya 

 no why not my dear why shouldn t i i like him he is kind 
he is one of god s chosen he s a benefactor he once gave me ten
rubles i remember when i was in kiev crazy cyril says to me he s
one of god s own and goes barefoot summer and winter he says 
 why are you not going to the right place go to koly zin where a
wonder working icon of the holy mother of god has been revealed on
hearing those words i said good by to the holy folk and went 

all were silent only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones 
drawing in her breath 

 so i come master and the people say to me a great blessing has
been revealed holy oil trickles from the cheeks of our blessed mother 
the holy virgin mother of god 

 all right all right you can tell us afterwards said princess
mary flushing 

 let me ask her said pierre did you see it yourselves he
inquired 

 oh yes master i was found worthy such a brightness on the face
like the light of heaven and from the blessed mother s cheek it drops
and drops 

 but dear me that must be a fraud said pierre na vely who had
listened attentively to the pilgrim 

 oh master what are you saying exclaimed the horrified
pelag ya turning to princess mary for support 

 they impose on the people he repeated 

 lord jesus christ exclaimed the pilgrim woman crossing herself 
 oh don t speak so master there was a general who did not
believe and said the monks cheat and as soon as he d said it
he went blind and he dreamed that the holy virgin mother of the kiev
catacombs came to him and said believe in me and i will make you
whole so he begged take me to her take me to her it s the
real truth i m telling you i saw it myself so he was brought quite
blind straight to her and he goes up to her and falls down and says 
 make me whole says he and i ll give thee what the tsar
bestowed on me i saw it myself master the star is fixed into the
icon well and what do you think he received his sight it s a sin
to speak so god will punish you she said admonishingly turning to
pierre 

 how did the star get into the icon pierre asked 

 and was the holy mother promoted to the rank of general said
prince andrew with a smile 

pelag ya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands 

 oh master master what a sin and you who have a son she began 
her pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red master what have you
said god forgive you and she crossed herself lord forgive him 
my dear what does it mean she asked turning to princess
mary she got up and almost crying began to arrange her wallet she
evidently felt frightened and ashamed to have accepted charity in a
house where such things could be said and was at the same time sorry to
have now to forgo the charity of this house 

 now why need you do it said princess mary why did you come
to me 

 come pelag ya i was joking said pierre princesse ma
parole je n ai pas voulu l offenser i did not mean anything 
i was only joking he said smiling shyly and trying to efface his
offense it was all my fault and andrew was only joking 

 princess on my word i did not wish to offend her 


pelag ya stopped doubtfully but in pierre s face there was such a
look of sincere penitence and prince andrew glanced so meekly now at
her and now at pierre that she was gradually reassured 





chapter xiv

the pilgrim woman was appeased and being encouraged to talk gave a
long account of father amphilochus who led so holy a life that his
hands smelled of incense and how on her last visit to kiev some monks
she knew let her have the keys of the catacombs and how she taking
some dried bread with her had spent two days in the catacombs with
the saints i d pray awhile to one ponder awhile then go on to
another i d sleep a bit and then again go and kiss the relics and
there was such peace all around such blessedness that one don t want
to come out even into the light of heaven again 

pierre listened to her attentively and seriously prince andrew went out
of the room and then leaving god s folk to finish their tea 
princess mary took pierre into the drawing room 

 you are very kind she said to him 

 oh i really did not mean to hurt her feelings i understand them so
well and have the greatest respect for them 

princess mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionately 

 i have known you a long time you see and am as fond of you as of a
brother she said how do you find andrew she added hurriedly 
not giving him time to reply to her affectionate words i am very
anxious about him his health was better in the winter but last spring
his wound reopened and the doctor said he ought to go away for a
cure and i am also very much afraid for him spiritually he has not a
character like us women who when we suffer can weep away our sorrows 
he keeps it all within him today he is cheerful and in good spirits 
but that is the effect of your visit he is not often like that if
you could persuade him to go abroad he needs activity and this quiet
regular life is very bad for him others don t notice it but i see
it 

toward ten o clock the men servants rushed to the front door hearing
the bells of the old prince s carriage approaching prince andrew and
pierre also went out into the porch 

 who s that asked the old prince noticing pierre as he got out
of the carriage 

 ah very glad kiss me he said having learned who the young
stranger was 

the old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to pierre 

before supper prince andrew coming back to his father s study found
him disputing hotly with his visitor pierre was maintaining that a time
would come when there would be no more wars the old prince disputed it
chaffingly but without getting angry 

 drain the blood from men s veins and put in water instead then
there will be no more war old women s nonsense old women s
nonsense he repeated but still he patted pierre affectionately
on the shoulder and then went up to the table where prince andrew 
evidently not wishing to join in the conversation was looking over the
papers his father had brought from town the old prince went up to him
and began to talk business 

 the marshal a count rost v hasn t sent half his contingent he
came to town and wanted to invite me to dinner i gave him a pretty
dinner and there look at this well my boy the old prince
went on addressing his son and patting pierre on the shoulder a
fine fellow your friend i like him he stirs me up another says
clever things and one doesn t care to listen but this one talks
rubbish yet stirs an old fellow up well go get along perhaps i ll
come and sit with you at supper we ll have another dispute make
friends with my little fool princess mary he shouted after pierre 
through the door 

only now on his visit to bald hills did pierre fully realize the
strength and charm of his friendship with prince andrew that charm was
not expressed so much in his relations with him as with all his family
and with the household with the stern old prince and the gentle timid
princess mary though he had scarcely known them pierre at once felt
like an old friend they were all fond of him already not only princess
mary who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims gave him her
most radiant looks but even the one year old prince nicholas as
his grandfather called him smiled at pierre and let himself be taken
in his arms and michael iv novich and mademoiselle bourienne looked at
him with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince 

the old prince came in to supper this was evidently on pierre s
account and during the two days of the young man s visit he was
extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again 

when pierre had gone and the members of the household met together they
began to express their opinions of him as people always do after a new
acquaintance has left but as seldom happens no one said anything but
what was good of him 





chapter xv

when returning from his leave rost v felt for the first time how
close was the bond that united him to den sov and the whole regiment 

on approaching it rost v felt as he had done when approaching his home
in moscow when he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform
of his regiment when he recognized red haired dem ntyev and saw the
picket ropes of the roan horses when lavr shka gleefully shouted to
his master the count has come and den sov who had been asleep
on his bed ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him 
and the officers collected round to greet the new arrival rost v
experienced the same feeling as when his mother his father and his
sister had embraced him and tears of joy choked him so that he could
not speak the regiment was also a home and as unalterably dear and
precious as his parents house 

when he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and had
been reassigned to his former squadron had been on duty and had gone
out foraging when he had again entered into all the little interests
of the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one
narrow unchanging frame he experienced the same sense of peace of
moral support and the same sense of being at home here in his own
place as he had felt under the parental roof but here was none of
all that turmoil of the world at large where he did not know his right
place and took mistaken decisions here was no s nya with whom he
ought or ought not to have an explanation here was no possibility of
going there or not going there here there were not twenty four hours
in the day which could be spent in such a variety of ways there was not
that innumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer to him or
farther from him than another there were none of those uncertain and
undefined money relations with his father and nothing to recall that
terrible loss to d lokhov here in the regiment all was clear and
simple the whole world was divided into two unequal parts one our
p vlograd regiment the other all the rest and the rest was no
concern of his in the regiment everything was definite who was
lieutenant who captain who was a good fellow who a bad one and most
of all who was a comrade the canteenkeeper gave one credit one s
pay came every four months there was nothing to think out or decide 
you had only to do nothing that was considered bad in the p vlograd
regiment and when given an order to do what was clearly distinctly 
and definitely ordered and all would be well 

having once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental
life rost v felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down to
rest life in the regiment during this campaign was all the pleasanter
for him because after his loss to d lokhov for which in spite
of all his family s efforts to console him he could not forgive
himself he had made up his mind to atone for his fault by serving 
not as he had done before but really well and by being a perfectly
first rate comrade and officer in a word a splendid man altogether a
thing which seemed so difficult out in the world but so possible in the
regiment 

after his losses he had determined to pay back his debt to his parents
in five years he received ten thousand rubles a year but now resolved
to take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to his
parents 

our army after repeated retreats and advances and battles at pult sk
and preussisch eylau was concentrated near bartenstein it was awaiting
the emperor s arrival and the beginning of a new campaign 

the p vlograd regiment belonging to that part of the army which had
served in the 1805 campaign had been recruiting up to strength in
russia and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the
campaign it had been neither at pult sk nor at preussisch eylau and 
when it joined the army in the field in the second half of the campaign 
was attached to pl tov s division 

pl tov s division was acting independently of the main army several
times parts of the p vlograd regiment had exchanged shots with
the enemy had taken prisoners and once had even captured marshal
oudinot s carriages in april the p vlograds were stationed immovably
for some weeks near a totally ruined and deserted german village 

a thaw had set in it was muddy and cold the ice on the river broke 
and the roads became impassable for days neither provisions for the
men nor fodder for the horses had been issued as no transports could
arrive the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages 
searching for potatoes but found few even of these 

everything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fled if any
remained they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be taken
from them even the soldiers usually pitiless enough instead of taking
anything from them often gave them the last of their rations 

the p vlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action but had
lost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness in the hospitals 
death was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever or the swelling
that came from bad food preferred to remain on duty and hardly able
to drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals 
when spring came on the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the
ground that looked like asparagus which for some reason they called
 m shka s sweet root it was very bitter but they wandered
about the fields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate it 
though they were ordered not to do so as it was a noxious plant that
spring a new disease broke out among the soldiers a swelling of the
arms legs and face which the doctors attributed to eating this root 
but in spite of all this the soldiers of den sov s squadron fed
chiefly on m shka s sweet root because it was the second week
that the last of the biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a
pound a man and the last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen 

the horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatched
roofs and had become terribly thin though still covered with tufts of
felty winter hair 

despite this destitution the soldiers and officers went on living just
as usual despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms the
hussars formed line for roll call kept things in order groomed their
horses polished their arms brought in straw from the thatched roofs in
place of fodder and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which
they rose up hungry joking about their nasty food and their hunger as
usual in their spare time they lit bonfires steamed themselves before
them naked smoked picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes told
and listened to stories of pot mkin s and suv rov s campaigns or
to legends of al sha the sly or the priest s laborer mik lka 

the officers as usual lived in twos and threes in the roofless 
half ruined houses the seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and 
in general food for the men the younger ones occupied themselves as
before some playing cards there was plenty of money though there was
no food some with more innocent games such as quoits and skittles 
the general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of partly because
nothing certain was known about it partly because there was a vague
feeling that in the main it was going badly 

rost v lived as before with den sov and since their furlough they
had become more friendly than ever den sov never spoke of rost v s
family but by the tender friendship his commander showed him rost v
felt that the elder hussar s luckless love for nat sha played a part
in strengthening their friendship den sov evidently tried to expose
rost v to danger as seldom as possible and after an action greeted his
safe return with evident joy on one of his foraging expeditions in
a deserted and ruined village to which he had come in search of
provisions rost v found a family consisting of an old pole and his
daughter with an infant in arms they were half clad hungry too weak
to get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a conveyance rost v
brought them to his quarters placed them in his own lodging and
kept them for some weeks while the old man was recovering one of his
comrades talking of women began chaffing rost v saying that he was
more wily than any of them and that it would not be a bad thing if he
introduced to them the pretty polish girl he had saved rost v took
the joke as an insult flared up and said such unpleasant things to the
officer that it was all den sov could do to prevent a duel when
the officer had gone away den sov who did not himself know what
rost v s relations with the polish girl might be began to upbraid
him for his quickness of temper and rost v replied 

 say what you like she is like a sister to me and i can t tell
you how it offended me because well for that reason 

den sov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room
without looking at rost v as was his way at moments of deep feeling 

 ah what a mad bweed you wost vs are he muttered and rost v
noticed tears in his eyes 





chapter xvi

in april the troops were enlivened by news of the emperor s arrival 
but rost v had no chance of being present at the review he held at
bartenstein as the p vlograds were at the outposts far beyond that
place 

they were bivouacking den sov and rost v were living in an earth hut 
dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf the
hut was made in the following manner which had then come into vogue a
trench was dug three and a half feet wide four feet eight inches deep 
and eight feet long at one end of the trench steps were cut out and
these formed the entrance and vestibule the trench itself was the room 
in which the lucky ones such as the squadron commander had a board 
lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance to serve as a table on
each side of the trench the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two
and a half feet and this did duty for bedsteads and couches the roof
was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench
and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the table 
den sov who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his
squadron liked him had also a board in the roof at the farther end 
with a piece of broken but mended glass in it for a window when it
was very cold embers from the soldiers campfire were placed on
a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the reception room as
den sov called that part of the hut and it was then so warm that the
officers of whom there were always some with den sov and rost v sat
in their shirt sleeves 

in april rost v was on orderly duty one morning between seven and
eight returning after a sleepless night he sent for embers changed
his rain soaked underclothes said his prayers drank tea got warm 
then tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner and 
his face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but his
shirt lay down on his back putting his arms under his head he was
pleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few days
for his last reconnoitering expedition and was awaiting den sov who
had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk 

suddenly he heard den sov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut 
evidently much excited rost v moved to the window to see whom he was
speaking to and saw the quartermaster topch enko 

 i ordered you not to let them eat that m shka woot stuff 
den sov was shouting and i saw with my own eyes how lazarch k
bwought some fwom the fields 

 i have given the order again and again your honor but they don t
obey answered the quartermaster 

rost v lay down again on his bed and thought complacently let
him fuss and bustle now my job s done and i m lying
down capitally he could hear that lavr shka that sly bold
orderly of den sov s was talking as well as the quartermaster 
lavr shka was saying something about loaded wagons biscuits and oxen
he had seen when he had gone out for provisions 

then den sov s voice was heard shouting farther and farther away 
 saddle second platoon 

 where are they off to now thought rost v 

five minutes later den sov came into the hut climbed with muddy boots
on the bed lit his pipe furiously scattered his things about took
his leaded whip buckled on his saber and went out again in answer to
rost v s inquiry where he was going he answered vaguely and crossly
that he had some business 

 let god and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards said den sov
going out and rost v heard the hoofs of several horses splashing
through the mud he did not even trouble to find out where den sov had
gone having got warm in his corner he fell asleep and did not leave
the hut till toward evening den sov had not yet returned the weather
had cleared up and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were
playing sv yka laughing as they threw their missiles which buried
themselves in the soft mud rost v joined them in the middle of the
game the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on
their skinny horses behind them the wagons escorted by the hussars drew
up to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them 

 there now den sov has been worrying said rost v and here
are the provisions 

 so they are said the officers won t the soldiers be
glad 

a little behind the hussars came den sov accompanied by two infantry
officers with whom he was talking 

rost v went to meet them 

 i warn you captain one of the officers a short thin man 
evidently very angry was saying 

 haven t i told you i won t give them up replied den sov 

 you will answer for it captain it is mutiny seizing the transport
of one s own army our men have had nothing to eat for two days 

 and mine have had nothing for two weeks said den sov 

 it is robbery you ll answer for it sir said the infantry
officer raising his voice 

 now what are you pestewing me for cried den sov suddenly
losing his temper i shall answer for it and not you and you d
better not buzz about here till you get hurt be off go he shouted
at the officers 

 very well then shouted the little officer undaunted and not
riding away if you are determined to rob i ll 

 go to the devil quick ma ch while you re safe and sound and
den sov turned his horse on the officer 

 very well very well muttered the officer threateningly and
turning his horse he trotted away jolting in his saddle 

 a dog astwide a fence a weal dog astwide a fence shouted
den sov after him the most insulting expression a cavalryman can
address to a mounted infantryman and riding up to rost v he burst out
laughing 

 i ve taken twansports from the infantwy by force he said 
 after all can t let our men starve 

the wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an
infantry regiment but learning from lavr shka that the transport
was unescorted den sov with his hussars had seized it by force the
soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely and they even shared
them with the other squadrons 

the next day the regimental commander sent for den sov and holding his
fingers spread out before his eyes said 

 this is how i look at this affair i know nothing about it and
won t begin proceedings but i advise you to ride over to the staff
and settle the business there in the commissariat department and if
possible sign a receipt for such and such stores received if not as
the demand was booked against an infantry regiment there will be a row
and the affair may end badly 

from the regimental commander s den sov rode straight to the staff
with a sincere desire to act on this advice in the evening he came
back to his dugout in a state such as rost v had never yet seen him in 
den sov could not speak and gasped for breath when rost v asked what
was the matter he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a
hoarse feeble voice 

alarmed at den sov s condition rost v suggested that he should
undress drink some water and send for the doctor 

 twy me for wobbewy oh some more water let them twy me but
i ll always thwash scoundwels and i ll tell the empewo 
ice he muttered 

the regimental doctor when he came said it was absolutely necessary
to bleed den sov a deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy
arm and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him 

 i get there began den sov now then where s your
chief s quarters they were pointed out please to wait 
 i ve widden twenty miles and have duties to attend to and no time
to wait announce me vewy well so out comes their head
chief also took it into his head to lecture me it s
wobbewy wobbewy i say is not done by man who seizes
pwovisions to feed his soldiers but by him who takes them to fill his
own pockets will you please be silent vewy good then
he says go and give a weceipt to the commissioner but your affair
will be passed on to headquarters i go to the commissioner i enter 
and at the table who do you think no but wait a bit who is it
that s starving us shouted den sov hitting the table with the
fist of his newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke down
and the tumblers on it jumped about tely nin what so it s
you who s starving us to death is it take this and this and i
hit him so pat stwaight on his snout ah what a what a 
and i sta ted fwashing him well i ve had a bit of fun i can tell
you cried den sov gleeful and yet angry his white teeth showing
under his black mustache i d have killed him if they hadn t
taken him away 

 but what are you shouting for calm yourself said rost v 
 you ve set your arm bleeding afresh wait we must tie it up
again 

den sov was bandaged up again and put to bed next day he woke calm and
cheerful 

but at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into rost v s and
den sov s dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed
them a paper addressed to major den sov from the regimental commander
in which inquiries were made about yesterday s occurrence the
adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad
turn that a court martial had been appointed and that in view of the
severity with which marauding and insubordination were now regarded 
degradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for 

the case as represented by the offended parties was that after
seizing the transports major den sov being drunk went to the chief
quartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief threatened
to strike him and on being led out had rushed into the office and given
two officials a thrashing and dislocated the arm of one of them 

in answer to rost v s renewed questions den sov said laughing 
that he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up
in it but that it was all nonsense and rubbish and he did not in the
least fear any kind of trial and that if those scoundrels dared attack
him he would give them an answer that they would not easily forget 

den sov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter but rost v knew him
too well not to detect that while hiding it from others at heart
he feared a court martial and was worried over the affair which was
evidently taking a bad turn every day letters of inquiry and notices
from the court arrived and on the first of may den sov was ordered
to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before
the staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat
office on the previous day pl tov reconnoitered with two cossack
regiments and two squadrons of hussars den sov as was his wont rode
out in front of the outposts parading his courage a bullet fired by
a french sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg perhaps at
another time den sov would not have left the regiment for so slight a
wound but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing
at the staff and went into hospital 





chapter xvii

in june the battle of friedland was fought in which the p vlograds did
not take part and after that an armistice was proclaimed rost v who
felt his friend s absence very much having no news of him since he
left and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his
affairs took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit den sov
in hospital 

the hospital was in a small prussian town that had been twice devastated
by russian and french troops because it was summer when it is so
beautiful out in the fields the little town presented a particularly
dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences its foul streets 
tattered inhabitants and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about 

the hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and
panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence
that had been pulled to pieces several bandaged soldiers with pale
swollen faces were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the
yard 

directly rost v entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of
putrefaction and hospital air on the stairs he met a russian army
doctor smoking a cigar the doctor was followed by a russian assistant 

 i can t tear myself to pieces the doctor was saying come to
mak r alex evich in the evening i shall be there 

the assistant asked some further questions 

 oh do the best you can isn t it all the same the doctor
noticed rost v coming upstairs 

 what do you want sir said the doctor what do you want 
the bullets having spared you do you want to try typhus this is a
pesthouse sir 

 how so asked rost v 

 typhus sir it s death to go in only we two mak ev and i he
pointed to the assistant keep on here some five of us doctors have
died in this place when a new one comes he is done for in a week 
said the doctor with evident satisfaction prussian doctors have been
invited here but our allies don t like it at all 

rost v explained that he wanted to see major den sov of the hussars 
who was wounded 

 i don t know i can t tell you sir only think i am alone in
charge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients it s
well that the charitable prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffee
and some lint each month or we should be lost he laughed four
hundred sir and they re always sending me fresh ones there are four
hundred eh he asked turning to the assistant 

the assistant looked fagged out he was evidently vexed and impatient
for the talkative doctor to go 

 major den sov rost v said again he was wounded at
molliten 

 dead i fancy eh mak ev queried the doctor in a tone of
indifference 

the assistant however did not confirm the doctor s words 

 is he tall and with reddish hair asked the doctor 

rost v described den sov s appearance 

 there was one like that said the doctor as if pleased that
one is dead i fancy however i ll look up our list we had a list 
have you got it mak ev 

 mak r alex evich has the list answered the assistant but if
you ll step into the officers wards you ll see for yourself 
he added turning to rost v 

 ah you d better not go sir said the doctor or you may
have to stay here yourself 

but rost v bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant
to show him the way 

 only don t blame me the doctor shouted up after him 

rost v and the assistant went into the dark corridor the smell was so
strong there that rost v held his nose and had to pause and collect
his strength before he could go on a door opened to the right and an
emaciated sallow man on crutches barefoot and in underclothing limped
out and leaning against the doorpost looked with glittering envious
eyes at those who were passing glancing in at the door rost v
saw that the sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and
overcoats 

 may i go in and look 

 what is there to see said the assistant 

but just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in 
rost v entered the soldiers ward the foul air to which he had
already begun to get used in the corridor was still stronger here it
was a little different more pungent and one felt that this was where
it originated 

in the long room brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows 
the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls and
leaving a passage in the middle most of them were unconscious and
paid no attention to the newcomers those who were conscious raised
themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces and all looked intently at
rost v with the same expression of hope of relief reproach and
envy of another s health rost v went to the middle of the room and
looking through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same
thing there he stood still looking silently around he had not at all
expected such a sight just before him almost across the middle of the
passage on the bare floor lay a sick man probably a cossack to judge
by the cut of his hair the man lay on his back his huge arms and legs
outstretched his face was purple his eyes were rolled back so that
only the whites were seen and on his bare legs and arms which were
still red the veins stood out like cords he was knocking the back of
his head against the floor hoarsely uttering some word which he kept
repeating rost v listened and made out the word it was drink 
drink a drink rost v glanced round looking for someone who would
put this man back in his place and bring him water 

 who looks after the sick here he asked the assistant 

just then a commissariat soldier a hospital orderly came in from the
next room marching stiffly and drew up in front of rost v 

 good day your honor he shouted rolling his eyes at rost v and
evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities 

 get him to his place and give him some water said rost v 
pointing to the cossack 

 yes your honor the soldier replied complacently and rolling
his eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter but did not
move 

 no it s impossible to do anything here thought rost v 
lowering his eyes and he was going out but became aware of an intense
look fixed on him on his right and he turned close to the corner on
an overcoat sat an old unshaven gray bearded soldier as thin as a
skeleton with a stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on rost v 
the man s neighbor on one side whispered something to him pointing
at rost v who noticed that the old man wanted to speak to him he drew
nearer and saw that the old man had only one leg bent under him the
other had been amputated above the knee his neighbor on the other side 
who lay motionless some distance from him with his head thrown back was
a young soldier with a snub nose his pale waxen face was still freckled
and his eyes were rolled back rost v looked at the young soldier and a
cold chill ran down his back 

 why this one seems he began turning to the assistant 

 and how we ve been begging your honor said the old soldier 
his jaw quivering he s been dead since morning after all we re
men not dogs 

 i ll send someone at once he shall be taken away taken away at
once said the assistant hurriedly let us go your honor 

 yes yes let us go said rost v hastily and lowering his
eyes and shrinking he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of
reproachful envious eyes that were fixed upon him and went out of the
room 





chapter xviii

going along the corridor the assistant led rost v to the officers 
wards consisting of three rooms the doors of which stood open there
were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying or
sitting on them some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing
gowns the first person rost v met in the officers ward was a thin
little man with one arm who was walking about the first room in a
nightcap and hospital dressing gown with a pipe between his teeth 
rost v looked at him trying to remember where he had seen him before 

 see where we ve met again said the little man t shin 
t shin don t you remember who gave you a lift at sch n grabern 
and i ve had a bit cut off you see he went on with a smile 
pointing to the empty sleeve of his dressing gown looking for
vas li dm trich den sov my neighbor he added when he heard
who rost v wanted here here and t shin led him into the next
room from whence came sounds of several laughing voices 

 how can they laugh or even live at all here thought rost v 
still aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong
in the soldiers ward and still seeming to see fixed on him those
envious looks which had followed him out from both sides and the face
of that young soldier with eyes rolled back 

den sov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket though
it was nearly noon 

 ah wost v how are you how are you he called out still in the
same voice as in the regiment but rost v noticed sadly that under this
habitual ease and animation some new sinister hidden feeling showed
itself in the expression of den sov s face and the intonations of his
voice 

his wound though a slight one had not yet healed even now six weeks
after he had been hit his face had the same swollen pallor as the faces
of the other hospital patients but it was not this that struck rost v 
what struck him was that den sov did not seem glad to see him and
smiled at him unnaturally he did not ask about the regiment nor about
the general state of affairs and when rost v spoke of these matters
did not listen 

rost v even noticed that den sov did not like to be reminded of the
regiment or in general of that other free life which was going on
outside the hospital he seemed to try to forget that old life and
was only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers on
rost v s inquiry as to how the matter stood he at once produced from
under his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the
rough draft of his answer to it he became animated when he began
reading his paper and specially drew rost v s attention to the
stinging rejoinders he made to his enemies his hospital companions 
who had gathered round rost v a fresh arrival from the world
outside gradually began to disperse as soon as den sov began reading
his answer rost v noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had
already heard that story more than once and were tired of it only the
man who had the next bed a stout uhlan continued to sit on his bed 
gloomily frowning and smoking a pipe and little one armed t shin still
listened shaking his head disapprovingly in the middle of the reading 
the uhlan interrupted den sov 

 but what i say is he said turning to rost v it would be
best simply to petition the emperor for pardon they say great rewards
will now be distributed and surely a pardon would be granted 

 me petition the empewo exclaimed den sov in a voice to which
he tried hard to give the old energy and fire but which sounded like
an expression of irritable impotence what for if i were a wobber i
would ask mercy but i m being court martialed for bwinging wobbers
to book let them twy me i m not afwaid of anyone i ve served
the tsar and my countwy honowably and have not stolen and am i to be
degwaded listen i m w iting to them stwaight this is what i
say if i had wobbed the tweasuwy 

 it s certainly well written said t shin but that s not
the point vas li dm trich and he also turned to rost v one
has to submit and vas li dm trich doesn t want to you know the
auditor told you it was a bad business 

 well let it be bad said den sov 

 the auditor wrote out a petition for you continued t shin 
 and you ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it no doubt
he indicating rost v has connections on the staff you won t
find a better opportunity 

 haven t i said i m not going to gwovel den sov interrupted
him went on reading his paper 

rost v had not the courage to persuade den sov though he
instinctively felt that the way advised by t shin and the other
officers was the safest and though he would have been glad to be of
service to den sov he knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty
temper 

when the reading of den sov s virulent reply which took more than an
hour was over rost v said nothing and he spent the rest of the day
in a most dejected state of mind amid den sov s hospital comrades 
who had gathered round him telling them what he knew and listening to
their stories den sov was moodily silent all the evening 

late in the evening when rost v was about to leave he asked den sov
whether he had no commission for him 

 yes wait a bit said den sov glancing round at the officers 
and taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window where
he had an inkpot and sat down to write 

 it seems it s no use knocking one s head against a wall he
said coming from the window and giving rost v a large envelope in
it was the petition to the emperor drawn up by the auditor in
which den sov without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat
officials simply asked for pardon 

 hand it in it seems 

he did not finish but gave a painfully unnatural smile 





chapter xix

having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of
den sov s affairs rost v rode to tilsit with the letter to the
emperor 

on the thirteenth of june the french and russian emperors arrived in
tilsit bor s drubetsk y had asked the important personage on whom he
was in attendance to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at
tilsit 

 i should like to see the great man he said alluding to napoleon 
whom hitherto he like everyone else had always called buonaparte 

 you are speaking of buonaparte asked the general smiling 

bor s looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was
being tested 

 i am speaking prince of the emperor napoleon he replied the
general patted him on the shoulder with a smile 

 you will go far he said and took him to tilsit with him 

bor s was among the few present at the niemen on the day the two
emperors met he saw the raft decorated with monograms saw napoleon
pass before the french guards on the farther bank of the river saw the
pensive face of the emperor alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern
on the bank of the niemen awaiting napoleon s arrival saw both
emperors get into boats and saw how napoleon reaching the raft
first stepped quickly forward to meet alexander and held out his hand
to him and how they both retired into the pavilion since he had begun
to move in the highest circles bor s had made it his habit to watch
attentively all that went on around him and to note it down at the time
of the meeting at tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with
napoleon and about the uniforms they wore and listened attentively to
words spoken by important personages at the moment the emperors went
into the pavilion he looked at his watch and did not forget to look at
it again when alexander came out the interview had lasted an hour and
fifty three minutes he noted this down that same evening among other
facts he felt to be of historic importance as the emperor s suite
was a very small one it was a matter of great importance for a man who
valued his success in the service to be at tilsit on the occasion of
this interview between the two emperors and having succeeded in this 
bor s felt that henceforth his position was fully assured he had not
only become known but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted
him twice he had executed commissions to the emperor himself so
that the latter knew his face and all those at court far from
cold shouldering him as at first when they considered him a newcomer 
would now have been surprised had he been absent 

bor s lodged with another adjutant the polish count zhil nski 
zhil nski a pole brought up in paris was rich and passionately
fond of the french and almost every day of the stay at tilsit french
officers of the guard and from french headquarters were dining and
lunching with him and bor s 

on the evening of the twenty fourth of june count zhil nski arranged a
supper for his french friends the guest of honor was an aide de camp of
napoleon s there were also several french officers of the guard 
and a page of napoleon s a young lad of an old aristocratic french
family that same day rost v profiting by the darkness to avoid being
recognized in civilian dress came to tilsit and went to the lodging
occupied by bor s and zhil nski 

rost v in common with the whole army from which he came was far
from having experienced the change of feeling toward napoleon and the
french who from being foes had suddenly become friends that had
taken place at headquarters and in bor s in the army bonaparte and
the french were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger contempt 
and fear only recently talking with one of pl tov s cossack
officers rost v had argued that if napoleon were taken prisoner he
would be treated not as a sovereign but as a criminal quite lately 
happening to meet a wounded french colonel on the road rost v had
maintained with heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate
sovereign and the criminal bonaparte rost v was therefore unpleasantly
struck by the presence of french officers in bor s lodging dressed
in uniforms he had been accustomed to see from quite a different point
of view from the outposts of the flank as soon as he noticed a french
officer who thrust his head out of the door that warlike feeling of
hostility which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly
seized him he stopped at the threshold and asked in russian whether
drubetsk y lived there bor s hearing a strange voice in the
anteroom came out to meet him an expression of annoyance showed itself
for a moment on his face on first recognizing rost v 

 ah it s you very glad very glad to see you he said however 
coming toward him with a smile but rost v had noticed his first
impulse 

 i ve come at a bad time i think i should not have come but i have
business he said coldly 

 no i only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment 
dans un moment je suis vous he said answering someone who
called him 

 in a minute i shall be at your disposal 


 i see i m intruding rost v repeated 

the look of annoyance had already disappeared from bor s face 
having evidently reflected and decided how to act he very quietly took
both rost v s hands and led him into the next room his eyes looking
serenely and steadily at rost v seemed to be veiled by something 
as if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality so it seemed to
rost v 

 oh come now as if you could come at a wrong time said bor s 
and he led him into the room where the supper table was laid and
introduced him to his guests explaining that he was not a civilian but
an hussar officer and an old friend of his 

 count zhil nski le comte n n le capitaine s s said he 
naming his guests rost v looked frowningly at the frenchmen bowed
reluctantly and remained silent 

zhil nski evidently did not receive this new russian person very
willingly into his circle and did not speak to rost v bor s did not
appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and with the same
pleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which
he had met rost v tried to enliven the conversation one of the
frenchmen with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen 
addressed the obstinately taciturn rost v saying that the latter had
probably come to tilsit to see the emperor 

 no i came on business replied rost v briefly 

rost v had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of
dissatisfaction on bor s face and as always happens to those in a
bad humor it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion
and that he was in everybody s way he really was in their way for he
alone took no part in the conversation which again became general the
looks the visitors cast on him seemed to say and what is he sitting
here for he rose and went up to bor s 

 anyhow i m in your way he said in a low tone come and talk
over my business and i ll go away 

 oh no not at all said bor s but if you are tired come and
lie down in my room and have a rest 

 yes really 

they went into the little room where bor s slept rost v without
sitting down began at once irritably as if bor s were to blame in
some way telling him about den sov s affair asking him whether 
through his general he could and would intercede with the emperor on
den sov s behalf and get den sov s petition handed in when he
and bor s were alone rost v felt for the first time that he could not
look bor s in the face without a sense of awkwardness bor s with one
leg crossed over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender
fingers of his right listened to rost v as a general listens to the
report of a subordinate now looking aside and now gazing straight into
rost v s eyes with the same veiled look each time this happened
rost v felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyes 

 i have heard of such cases and know that his majesty is very severe
in such affairs i think it would be best not to bring it before the
emperor but to apply to the commander of the corps but in general 
i think 

 so you don t want to do anything well then say so rost v
almost shouted not looking bor s in the face 

bor s smiled 

 on the contrary i will do what i can only i thought 

at that moment zhil nski s voice was heard calling bor s 

 well then go go go said rost v and refusing supper and
remaining alone in the little room he walked up and down for a long
time hearing the lighthearted french conversation from the next room 





chapter xx

rost v had come to tilsit the day least suitable for a petition
on den sov s behalf he could not himself go to the general in
attendance as he was in mufti and had come to tilsit without permission
to do so and bor s even had he wished to could not have done so on
the following day on that day june 27 the preliminaries of peace were
signed the emperors exchanged decorations alexander received the cross
of the legion of honor and napoleon the order of st andrew of the
first degree and a dinner had been arranged for the evening given by
a battalion of the french guards to the preobrazh nsk battalion the
emperors were to be present at that banquet 

rost v felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with bor s that when the
latter looked in after supper he pretended to be asleep and early next
morning went away avoiding bor s in his civilian clothes and a
round hat he wandered about the town staring at the french and their
uniforms and at the streets and houses where the russian and french
emperors were staying in a square he saw tables being set up and
preparations made for the dinner he saw the russian and french colors
draped from side to side of the streets with huge monograms a and n in
the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed 

 bor s doesn t want to help me and i don t want to ask him 
that s settled thought nicholas all is over between us but
i won t leave here without having done all i can for den sov and
certainly not without getting his letter to the emperor the emperor 
he is here thought rost v who had unconsciously returned to the
house where alexander lodged 

saddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were
assembling evidently preparing for the emperor to come out 

 i may see him at any moment thought rost v if only i were
to hand the letter direct to him and tell him all could they really
arrest me for my civilian clothes surely not he would understand on
whose side justice lies he understands everything knows everything 
who can be more just more magnanimous than he and even if they did
arrest me for being here what would it matter thought he looking
at an officer who was entering the house the emperor occupied after
all people do go in it s all nonsense i ll go in and hand
the letter to the emperor myself so much the worse for drubetsk y who
drives me to it and suddenly with a determination he himself did not
expect rost v felt for the letter in his pocket and went straight to
the house 

 no i won t miss my opportunity now as i did after austerlitz 
he thought expecting every moment to meet the monarch and conscious of
the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought i will fall at
his feet and beseech him he will lift me up will listen and will even
thank me i am happy when i can do good but to remedy injustice is
the greatest happiness rost v fancied the sovereign saying and
passing people who looked after him with curiosity he entered the porch
of the emperor s house 

a broad staircase led straight up from the entry and to the right he
saw a closed door below under the staircase was a door leading to the
lower floor 

 whom do you want someone inquired 

 to hand in a letter a petition to his majesty said nicholas 
with a tremor in his voice 

 a petition this way to the officer on duty he was shown the
door leading downstairs only it won t be accepted 

on hearing this indifferent voice rost v grew frightened at what
he was doing the thought of meeting the emperor at any moment was so
fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away 
but the official who had questioned him opened the door and rost v
entered 

a short stout man of about thirty in white breeches and high boots and
a batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on standing in that
room and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a
new pair of handsome silk embroidered braces that for some reason 
attracted rost v s attention this man was speaking to someone in the
adjoining room 

 a good figure and in her first bloom he was saying but on seeing
rost v he stopped short and frowned 

 what is it a petition 

 what is it asked the person in the other room 

 another petitioner answered the man with the braces 

 tell him to come later he ll be coming out directly we must
go 

 later later tomorrow it s too late 

rost v turned and was about to go but the man in the braces stopped
him 

 whom have you come from who are you 

 i come from major den sov answered rost v 

 are you an officer 

 lieutenant count rost v 

 what audacity hand it in through your commander and go along with
you go and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed
him 

rost v went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were
many officers and generals in full parade uniform whom he had to pass 

cursing his temerity his heart sinking at the thought of finding
himself at any moment face to face with the emperor and being put to
shame and arrested in his presence fully alive now to the impropriety
of his conduct and repenting of it rost v with downcast eyes was
making his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a
familiar voice called him and a hand detained him 

 what are you doing here sir in civilian dress asked a deep
voice 

it was a cavalry general who had obtained the emperor s special favor
during this campaign and who had formerly commanded the division in
which rost v was serving 

rost v in dismay began justifying himself but seeing the kindly 
jocular face of the general he took him aside and in an excited voice
told him the whole affair asking him to intercede for den sov whom
the general knew having heard rost v to the end the general shook his
head gravely 

 i m sorry sorry for that fine fellow give me the letter 

hardly had rost v handed him the letter and finished explaining
den sov s case when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard
on the stairs and the general leaving him went to the porch the
gentlemen of the emperor s suite ran down the stairs and went to their
horses hayne the same groom who had been at austerlitz led up the
emperor s horse and the faint creak of a footstep rost v knew at
once was heard on the stairs forgetting the danger of being recognized 
rost v went close to the porch together with some inquisitive
civilians and again after two years saw those features he adored 
that same face and same look and step and the same union of majesty and
mildness and the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign
rose again in rost v s soul in all its old force in the uniform of
the preobrazh nsk regiment white chamois leather breeches and high
boots and wearing a star rost v did not know it was that of the
l gion d honneur the monarch came out into the porch putting on
his gloves and carrying his hat under his arm he stopped and looked
about him brightening everything around by his glance he spoke a few
words to some of the generals and recognizing the former commander of
rost v s division smiled and beckoned to him 

all the suite drew back and rost v saw the general talking for some
time to the emperor 

the emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse 
again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers among whom
was rost v moved nearer to the emperor stopping beside his horse 
with his hand on the saddle the emperor turned to the cavalry general
and said in a loud voice evidently wishing to be heard by all 

 i cannot do it general i cannot because the law is stronger than
i and he raised his foot to the stirrup 

the general bowed his head respectfully and the monarch mounted and
rode down the street at a gallop beside himself with enthusiasm 
rost v ran after him with the crowd 





chapter xxi

the emperor rode to the square where facing one another a battalion
of the preobrazh nsk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the
french guards in their bearskin caps on the left 

as the tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions which presented
arms another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank and
at the head of them rost v recognized napoleon it could be no one
else he came at a gallop wearing a small hat a blue uniform open over
a white vest and the st andrew ribbon over his shoulder he was riding
a very fine thoroughbred gray arab horse with a crimson gold embroidered
saddlecloth on approaching alexander he raised his hat and as he did
so rost v with his cavalryman s eye could not help noticing
that napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle the battalions
shouted hurrah and vive l empereur napoleon said
something to alexander and both emperors dismounted and took each
other s hands napoleon s face wore an unpleasant and artificial
smile alexander was saying something affable to him 

in spite of the trampling of the french gendarmes horses which
were pushing back the crowd rost v kept his eyes on every movement
of alexander and bonaparte it struck him as a surprise that alexander
treated bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with
the tsar as if such relations with an emperor were an everyday matter
to him 

alexander and napoleon with the long train of their suites approached
the right flank of the preobrazh nsk battalion and came straight up to
the crowd standing there the crowd unexpectedly found itself so close
to the emperors that rost v standing in the front row was afraid he
might be recognized 

 sire i ask your permission to present the legion of honor to the
bravest of your soldiers said a sharp precise voice articulating
every letter 

this was said by the undersized napoleon looking up straight into
alexander s eyes alexander listened attentively to what was said to
him and bending his head smiled pleasantly 

 to him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war added
napoleon accentuating each syllable as with a composure and assurance
exasperating to rost v he ran his eyes over the russian ranks drawn
up before him who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their
emperor 

 will your majesty allow me to consult the colonel said alexander
and took a few hasty steps toward prince kozl vski the commander of
the battalion 

bonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand 
tore it in doing so and threw it away an aide de camp behind him
rushed forward and picked it up 

 to whom shall it be given the emperor alexander asked kozl vski 
in russian in a low voice 

 to whomever your majesty commands 

the emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and glancing back 
remarked 

 but we must give him an answer 

kozl vski scanned the ranks resolutely and included rost v in his
scrutiny 

 can it be me thought rost v 

 l zarev the colonel called with a frown and l zarev the
first soldier in the rank stepped briskly forward 

 where are you off to stop here voices whispered to l zarev who
did not know where to go l zarev stopped casting a sidelong look at
his colonel in alarm his face twitched as often happens to soldiers
called before the ranks 

napoleon slightly turned his head and put his plump little hand out
behind him as if to take something the members of his suite guessing
at once what he wanted moved about and whispered as they passed
something from one to another and a page the same one rost v
had seen the previous evening at bor s ran forward and bowing
respectfully over the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a
moment laid in it an order on a red ribbon napoleon without looking 
pressed two fingers together and the badge was between them then he
approached l zarev who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his
own monarch looked round at the emperor alexander to imply that what
he was now doing was done for the sake of his ally and the small white
hand holding the order touched one of l zarev s buttons it was as if
napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his hand to deign to touch
that soldier s breast for the soldier to be forever happy rewarded 
and distinguished from everyone else in the world napoleon merely laid
the cross on l zarev s breast and dropping his hand turned toward
alexander as though sure that the cross would adhere there and it
really did 

officious hands russian and french immediately seized the cross and
fastened it to the uniform l zarev glanced morosely at the little
man with white hands who was doing something to him and still standing
motionless presenting arms looked again straight into alexander s
eyes as if asking whether he should stand there or go away or do
something else but receiving no orders he remained for some time in
that rigid position 

the emperors remounted and rode away the preobrazh nsk battalion 
breaking rank mingled with the french guards and sat down at the tables
prepared for them 

l zarev sat in the place of honor russian and french officers embraced
him congratulated him and pressed his hands crowds of officers and
civilians drew near merely to see him a rumble of russian and french
voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square 
two officers with flushed faces looking cheerful and happy passed by
rost v 

 what d you think of the treat all on silver plate one of them
was saying have you seen l zarev 

 i have 

 tomorrow i hear the preobrazh nskis will give them a dinner 

 yes but what luck for l zarev twelve hundred francs pension for
life 

 here s a cap lads shouted a preobrazh nsk soldier donning a
shaggy french cap 

 it s a fine thing first rate 

 have you heard the password asked one guards officer of
another the day before yesterday it was napol on france 
bravoure yesterday alexandre russie grandeur one day our
emperor gives it and next day napoleon tomorrow our emperor will send
a st george s cross to the bravest of the french guards it has to be
done he must respond in kind 

bor s too with his friend zhil nski came to see the preobrazh nsk
banquet on his way back he noticed rost v standing by the corner of a
house 

 rost v how d you do we missed one another he said and could
not refrain from asking what was the matter so strangely dismal and
troubled was rost v s face 

 nothing nothing replied rost v 

 you ll call round 

 yes i will 

rost v stood at that corner for a long time watching the feast from a
distance in his mind a painful process was going on which he could
not bring to a conclusion terrible doubts rose in his soul now he
remembered den sov with his changed expression his submission and the
whole hospital with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease so
vividly did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he
looked round to see where the smell came from next he thought of that
self satisfied bonaparte with his small white hand who was now an
emperor liked and respected by alexander then why those severed
arms and legs and those dead men then again he thought of l zarev
rewarded and den sov punished and unpardoned he caught himself
harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened 

the smell of the food the preobrazh nskis were eating and a sense of
hunger recalled him from these reflections he had to get something to
eat before going away he went to a hotel he had noticed that morning 
there he found so many people among them officers who like himself 
had come in civilian clothes that he had difficulty in getting a
dinner two officers of his own division joined him the conversation
naturally turned on the peace the officers his comrades like most of
the army were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of
friedland they said that had we held out a little longer napoleon would
have been done for as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition 
nicholas ate and drank chiefly the latter in silence he finished a
couple of bottles of wine by himself the process in his mind went on
tormenting him without reaching a conclusion he feared to give way to
his thoughts yet could not get rid of them suddenly on one of the
officers saying that it was humiliating to look at the french 
rost v began shouting with uncalled for wrath and therefore much to
the surprise of the officers 

 how can you judge what s best he cried the blood suddenly
rushing to his face how can you judge the emperor s actions what
right have we to argue we cannot comprehend either the emperor s aims
or his actions 

 but i never said a word about the emperor said the officer 
justifying himself and unable to understand rost v s outburst 
except on the supposition that he was drunk 

but rost v did not listen to him 

 we are not diplomatic officials we are soldiers and nothing more 
he went on if we are ordered to die we must die if we re
punished it means that we have deserved it it s not for us to judge 
if the emperor pleases to recognize bonaparte as emperor and to conclude
an alliance with him it means that that is the right thing to do if
once we begin judging and arguing about everything nothing sacred
will be left that way we shall be saying there is no god nothing 
shouted nicholas banging the table very little to the point as it
seemed to his listeners but quite relevantly to the course of his own
thoughts 

 our business is to do our duty to fight and not to think that s
all said he 

 and to drink said one of the officers not wishing to quarrel 

 yes and to drink assented nicholas hullo there another
bottle he shouted 

in 1808 the emperor alexander went to erfurt for a fresh interview with
the emperor napoleon and in the upper circles of petersburg there was
much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting 





chapter xxii

in 1809 the intimacy between the world s two arbiters as
napoleon and alexander were called was such that when napoleon declared
war on austria a russian corps crossed the frontier to co operate with
our old enemy bonaparte against our old ally the emperor of austria and
in court circles the possibility of marriage between napoleon and one
of alexander s sisters was spoken of but besides considerations of
foreign policy the attention of russian society was at that time keenly
directed on the internal changes that were being undertaken in all the
departments of government 

life meanwhile real life with its essential interests of health and
sickness toil and rest and its intellectual interests in thought 
science poetry music love friendship hatred and passions went on
as usual independently of and apart from political friendship or enmity
with napoleon bonaparte and from all the schemes of reconstruction 





book six 1808 10





chapter i

prince andrew had spent two years continuously in the country 

all the plans pierre had attempted on his estates and constantly
changing from one thing to another had never accomplished were carried
out by prince andrew without display and without perceptible difficulty 

he had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which pierre lacked 
and without fuss or strain on his part this set things going 

on one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and became
free agricultural laborers this being one of the first examples of
the kind in russia on other estates the serfs compulsory labor was
commuted for a quitrent a trained midwife was engaged for boguch rovo
at his expense and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing to
the children of the peasants and household serfs 

prince andrew spent half his time at bald hills with his father and his
son who was still in the care of nurses the other half he spent in
 boguch rovo cloister as his father called prince andrew s
estate despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had
expressed to pierre he diligently followed all that went on received
many books and to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had
visitors from petersburg the very vortex of life these people lagged
behind himself who never left the country in knowledge of what was
happening in home and foreign affairs 

besides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety of
books prince andrew was at this time busy with a critical survey of
our last two unfortunate campaigns and with drawing up a proposal for a
reform of the army rules and regulations 

in the spring of 1809 he went to visit the ryaz n estates which had
been inherited by his son whose guardian he was 

warmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the cal che looking at the new
grass the first leaves on the birches and the first puffs of white
spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky he was not thinking of
anything but looked absent mindedly and cheerfully from side to side 

they crossed the ferry where he had talked with pierre the year before 
they went through the muddy village past threshing floors and green
fields of winter rye downhill where snow still lodged near the bridge 
uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain past strips of
stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there and into a
birch forest growing on both sides of the road in the forest it was
almost hot no wind could be felt the birches with their sticky green
leaves were motionless and lilac colored flowers and the first blades
of green grass were pushing up and lifting last year s leaves the
coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and there
among the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter on entering the
forest the horses began to snort and sweated visibly 

peter the footman made some remark to the coachman the latter assented 
but apparently the coachman s sympathy was not enough for peter and
he turned on the box toward his master 

 how pleasant it is your excellency he said with a respectful
smile 

 what 

 it s pleasant your excellency 

 what is he talking about thought prince andrew oh the
spring i suppose he thought as he turned round yes really
everything is green already how early the birches and cherry and
alders too are coming out but the oaks show no sign yet ah here is
one oak 

at the edge of the road stood an oak probably ten times the age of the
birches that formed the forest it was ten times as thick and twice as
tall as they it was an enormous tree its girth twice as great as a
man could embrace and evidently long ago some of its branches had been
broken off and its bark scarred with its huge ungainly limbs sprawling
unsymmetrically and its gnarled hands and fingers it stood an aged 
stern and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees only the
dead looking evergreen firs dotted about in the forest and this oak 
refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or
the sunshine 

 spring love happiness this oak seemed to say are you not
weary of that stupid meaningless constantly repeated fraud always the
same and always a fraud there is no spring no sun no happiness look
at those cramped dead firs ever the same and at me too sticking out
my broken and barked fingers just where they have grown whether from my
back or my sides as they have grown so i stand and i do not believe in
your hopes and your lies 

as he passed through the forest prince andrew turned several times to
look at that oak as if expecting something from it under the oak 
too were flowers and grass but it stood among them scowling rigid 
misshapen and grim as ever 

 yes the oak is right a thousand times right thought prince
andrew let others the young yield afresh to that fraud but we
know life our life is finished 

a whole sequence of new thoughts hopeless but mournfully pleasant rose
in his soul in connection with that tree during this journey he as
it were considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion 
restful in its hopelessness that it was not for him to begin anything
anew but that he must live out his life content to do no harm and
not disturbing himself or desiring anything 





chapter ii

prince andrew had to see the marshal of the nobility for the district
in connection with the affairs of the ryaz n estate of which he was
trustee this marshal was count ily rost v and in the middle of may
prince andrew went to visit him 

it was now hot spring weather the whole forest was already clothed in
green it was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to
bathe 

prince andrew depressed and preoccupied with the business about which
he had to speak to the marshal was driving up the avenue in the grounds
of the rost vs house at otr dnoe he heard merry girlish cries
behind some trees on the right and saw a group of girls running to cross
the path of his cal che ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a
dark haired remarkably slim pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress with
a white handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair
escaped the girl was shouting something but seeing that he was a
stranger ran back laughing without looking at him 

suddenly he did not know why he felt a pang the day was so beautiful 
the sun so bright everything around so gay but that slim pretty girl
did not know or wish to know of his existence and was contented and
cheerful in her own separate probably foolish but bright and happy
life what is she so glad about what is she thinking of not of
the military regulations or of the arrangement of the ryaz n serfs 
quitrents of what is she thinking why is she so happy prince
andrew asked himself with instinctive curiosity 

in 1809 count ily rost v was living at otr dnoe just as he had done
in former years that is entertaining almost the whole province with
hunts theatricals dinners and music he was glad to see prince
andrew as he was to see any new visitor and insisted on his staying
the night 

during the dull day in the course of which he was entertained by
his elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors the old
count s house was crowded on account of an approaching name day 
prince andrew repeatedly glanced at nat sha gay and laughing among the
younger members of the company and asked himself each time what is
she thinking about why is she so glad 

that night alone in new surroundings he was long unable to sleep he
read awhile and then put out his candle but relit it it was hot in the
room the inside shutters of which were closed he was cross with the
stupid old man as he called rost v who had made him stay by assuring
him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town and he
was vexed with himself for having stayed 

he got up and went to the window to open it as soon as he opened the
shutters the moonlight as if it had long been watching for this burst
into the room he opened the casement the night was fresh bright and
very still just before the window was a row of pollard trees looking
black on one side and with a silvery light on the other beneath the
trees grew some kind of lush wet bushy vegetation with silver lit
leaves and stems here and there farther back beyond the dark trees a
roof glittered with dew to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly
white trunk and branches and above it shone the moon nearly at its
full in a pale almost starless spring sky prince andrew leaned his
elbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that sky 

his room was on the first floor those in the rooms above were also
awake he heard female voices overhead 

 just once more said a girlish voice above him which prince andrew
recognized at once 

 but when are you coming to bed replied another voice 

 i won t i can t sleep what s the use come now for the last
time 

two girlish voices sang a musical passage the end of some song 

 oh how lovely now go to sleep and there s an end of it 

 you go to sleep but i can t said the first voice coming
nearer to the window she was evidently leaning right out for the
rustle of her dress and even her breathing could be heard everything
was stone still like the moon and its light and the shadows prince
andrew too dared not stir for fear of betraying his unintentional
presence 

 s nya s nya he again heard the first speaker oh how can
you sleep only look how glorious it is ah how glorious do wake up 
s nya she said almost with tears in her voice there never 
never was such a lovely night before 

s nya made some reluctant reply 

 do just come and see what a moon oh how lovely come here 
darling sweetheart come here there you see i feel like sitting down
on my heels putting my arms round my knees like this straining tight 
as tight as possible and flying away like this 

 take care you ll fall out 

he heard the sound of a scuffle and s nya s disapproving voice 
 it s past one o clock 

 oh you only spoil things for me all right go go 

again all was silent but prince andrew knew she was still sitting
there from time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh 

 o god o god what does it mean she suddenly exclaimed to bed
then if it must be and she slammed the casement 

 for her i might as well not exist thought prince andrew while he
listened to her voice for some reason expecting yet fearing that she
might say something about him there she is again as if it were on
purpose thought he 

in his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthful
thoughts and hopes contrary to the whole tenor of his life that unable
to explain his condition to himself he lay down and fell asleep at once 





chapter iii

next morning having taken leave of no one but the count and not
waiting for the ladies to appear prince andrew set off for home 

it was already the beginning of june when on his return journey he drove
into the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange and
memorable an impression on him in the forest the harness bells sounded
yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before for now all was
thick shady and dense and the young firs dotted about in the forest
did not jar on the general beauty but lending themselves to the mood
around were delicately green with fluffy young shoots 

the whole day had been hot somewhere a storm was gathering but only
a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly sprinkling the road
and the sappy leaves the left side of the forest was dark in the shade 
the right side glittered in the sunlight wet and shiny and scarcely
swayed by the breeze everything was in blossom the nightingales
trilled and their voices reverberated now near now far away 

 yes here in this forest was that oak with which i agreed thought
prince andrew but where is it he again wondered gazing at
the left side of the road and without recognizing it he looked with
admiration at the very oak he sought the old oak quite transfigured 
spreading out a canopy of sappy dark green foliage stood rapt and
slightly trembling in the rays of the evening sun neither gnarled
fingers nor old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in
evidence now through the hard century old bark even where there were
no twigs leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old
veteran could have produced 

 yes it is the same oak thought prince andrew and all at once he
was seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal all
the best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory austerlitz
with the lofty heavens his wife s dead reproachful face pierre at
the ferry that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night and that night
itself and the moon and all this rushed suddenly to his mind 

 no life is not over at thirty one prince andrew suddenly decided
finally and decisively it is not enough for me to know what i have
in me everyone must know it pierre and that young girl who wanted to
fly away into the sky everyone must know me so that my life may not be
lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it but so that
it may be reflected in them all and they and i may live in harmony 


on reaching home prince andrew decided to go to petersburg that autumn
and found all sorts of reasons for this decision a whole series of
sensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him
to go to petersburg and even to re enter the service kept springing
up in his mind he could not now understand how he could ever even have
doubted the necessity of taking an active share in life just as a month
before he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country
could ever enter his head it now seemed clear to him that all his
experience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to
some kind of work and again played an active part in life he did not
even remember how formerly on the strength of similar wretched logical
arguments it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if
he now after the lessons he had had in life allowed himself to believe
in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness
or love now reason suggested quite the opposite after that journey
to ryaz n he found the country dull his former pursuits no longer
interested him and often when sitting alone in his study he got up 
went to the mirror and gazed a long time at his own face then he would
turn away to the portrait of his dead lise who with hair curled la
grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame she
did not now say those former terrible words to him but looked simply 
merrily and inquisitively at him and prince andrew crossing his
arms behind him long paced the room now frowning now smiling as
he reflected on those irrational inexpressible thoughts secret as a
crime which altered his whole life and were connected with pierre with
fame with the girl at the window the oak and woman s beauty
and love and if anyone came into his room at such moments he was
particularly cold stern and above all unpleasantly logical 

 my dear princess mary entering at such a moment would say 
 little nicholas can t go out today it s very cold 

 if it were hot prince andrew would reply at such times very dryly
to his sister he could go out in his smock but as it is cold he
must wear warm clothes which were designed for that purpose that is
what follows from the fact that it is cold and not that a child who
needs fresh air should remain at home he would add with extreme
logic as if punishing someone for those secret illogical emotions that
stirred within him 

at such moments princess mary would think how intellectual work dries
men up 





chapter iv

prince andrew arrived in petersburg in august 1809 it was the time
when the youthful sper nski was at the zenith of his fame and his
reforms were being pushed forward with the greatest energy that same
august the emperor was thrown from his cal che injured his leg and
remained three weeks at peterhof receiving sper nski every day and no
one else at that time the two famous decrees were being prepared
that so agitated society abolishing court ranks and introducing
examinations to qualify for the grades of collegiate assessor and
state councilor and not merely these but a whole state constitution 
intended to change the existing order of government in russia legal 
administrative and financial from the council of state down to the
district tribunals now those vague liberal dreams with which the
emperor alexander had ascended the throne and which he had tried to put
into effect with the aid of his associates czartor ski novos ltsev 
kochub y and str gonov whom he himself in jest had called his
comit de salut public were taking shape and being realized 

now all these men were replaced by sper nski on the civil side and
arakch ev on the military soon after his arrival prince andrew as a
gentleman of the chamber presented himself at court and at a levee the
emperor though he met him twice did not favor him with a single word 
it had always seemed to prince andrew before that he was antipathetic
to the emperor and that the latter disliked his face and personality
generally and in the cold repellent glance the emperor gave him he
now found further confirmation of this surmise the courtiers explained
the emperor s neglect of him by his majesty s displeasure at
bolk nski s not having served since 1805 

 i know myself that one cannot help one s sympathies and
antipathies thought prince andrew so it will not do to present
my proposal for the reform of the army regulations to the emperor
personally but the project will speak for itself 

he mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal a friend
of his father s the field marshal made an appointment to see him 
received him graciously and promised to inform the emperor a few
days later prince andrew received notice that he was to go to see the
minister of war count arakch ev 


on the appointed day prince andrew entered count arakch ev s waiting
room at nine in the morning 

he did not know arakch ev personally had never seen him and all he
had heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man 

 he is minister of war a man trusted by the emperor and i need not
concern myself about his personal qualities he has been commissioned to
consider my project so he alone can get it adopted thought prince
andrew as he waited among a number of important and unimportant people
in count arakch ev s waiting room 

during his service chiefly as an adjutant prince andrew had seen the
anterooms of many important men and the different types of such rooms
were well known to him count arakch ev s anteroom had quite a
special character the faces of the unimportant people awaiting their
turn for an audience showed embarrassment and servility the faces of
those of higher rank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness covered
by a mask of unconcern and ridicule of themselves their situation and
the person for whom they were waiting some walked thoughtfully up and
down others whispered and laughed prince andrew heard the nickname
 s la andr evich and the words uncle will give it to us
hot in reference to count arakch ev one general an important
personage evidently feeling offended at having to wait so long sat
crossing and uncrossing his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself 

but the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all
faces that of fear prince andrew for the second time asked the
adjutant on duty to take in his name but received an ironical look and
was told that his turn would come in due course after some others had
been shown in and out of the minister s room by the adjutant on duty 
an officer who struck prince andrew by his humiliated and frightened air
was admitted at that terrible door this officer s audience lasted a
long time then suddenly the grating sound of a harsh voice was heard
from the other side of the door and the officer with pale face and
trembling lips came out and passed through the waiting room clutching
his head 

after this prince andrew was conducted to the door and the officer on
duty said in a whisper to the right at the window 

prince andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man of
forty with a long waist a long closely cropped head deep wrinkles 
scowling brows above dull greenish hazel eyes and an overhanging red
nose arakch ev turned his head toward him without looking at him 

 what is your petition asked arakch ev 

 i am not petitioning your excellency returned prince andrew
quietly 

arakch ev s eyes turned toward him 

 sit down said he prince bolk nski 

 i am not petitioning about anything his majesty the emperor has
deigned to send your excellency a project submitted by me 

 you see my dear sir i have read your project interrupted
arakch ev uttering only the first words amiably and then again
without looking at prince andrew relapsing gradually into a tone of
grumbling contempt you are proposing new military laws there are
many laws but no one to carry out the old ones nowadays everybody
designs laws it is easier writing than doing 

 i came at his majesty the emperor s wish to learn from your
excellency how you propose to deal with the memorandum i have
presented said prince andrew politely 

 i have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to the
committee i do not approve of it said arakch ev rising and taking
a paper from his writing table here and he handed it to prince
andrew 

across the paper was scrawled in pencil without capital letters 
misspelled and without punctuation unsoundly constructed because
resembles an imitation of the french military code and from the articles
of war needlessly deviating 

 to what committee has the memorandum been referred inquired
prince andrew 

 to the committee on army regulations and i have recommended that
your honor should be appointed a member but without a salary 

prince andrew smiled 

 i don t want one 

 a member without salary repeated arakch ev i have the
honor eh call the next one who else is there he shouted bowing
to prince andrew 





chapter v

while waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committee
prince andrew looked up his former acquaintances particularly those he
knew to be in power and whose aid he might need in petersburg he now
experienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle when
troubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling
circles where the future on which the fate of millions depended was
being shaped from the irritation of the older men the curiosity of the
uninitiated the reserve of the initiated the hurry and preoccupation
of everyone and the innumerable committees and commissions of whose
existence he learned every day he felt that now in 1809 here in
petersburg a vast civil conflict was in preparation the commander in
chief of which was a mysterious person he did not know but who was
supposed to be a man of genius sper nski and this movement of
reconstruction of which prince andrew had a vague idea and sper nski
its chief promoter began to interest him so keenly that the question
of the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his
consciousness 

prince andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in the
highest and most diverse petersburg circles of the day the reforming
party cordially welcomed and courted him in the first place because
he was reputed to be clever and very well read and secondly because by
liberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberal 
the party of the old and dissatisfied who censured the innovations 
turned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the
reforms simply because he was the son of his father the feminine
society world welcomed him gladly because he was rich distinguished a
good match and almost a newcomer with a halo of romance on account
of his supposed death and the tragic loss of his wife besides this
the general opinion of all who had known him previously was that he had
greatly improved during these last five years having softened and grown
more manly lost his former affectation pride and contemptuous irony 
and acquired the serenity that comes with years people talked about
him were interested in him and wanted to meet him 

the day after his interview with count arakch ev prince andrew spent
the evening at count kochub y s he told the count of his interview
with s la andr evich kochub y spoke of arakch ev by that nickname
with the same vague irony prince andrew had noticed in the minister of
war s anteroom 

 mon cher even in this case you can t do without michael
mikh ylovich sper nski he manages everything i ll speak to him he
has promised to come this evening 

 what has sper nski to do with the army regulations asked prince
andrew 

kochub y shook his head smilingly as if surprised at bolk nski s
simplicity 

 we were talking to him about you a few days ago kochub y
continued and about your freed plowmen 

 oh is it you prince who have freed your serfs said an old man
of catherine s day turning contemptuously toward bolk nski 

 it was a small estate that brought in no profit replied prince
andrew trying to extenuate his action so as not to irritate the old man
uselessly 

 afraid of being late said the old man looking at kochub y 

 there s one thing i don t understand he continued who
will plow the land if they are set free it is easy to write laws but
difficult to rule just the same as now i ask you count who will
be heads of the departments when everybody has to pass examinations 

 those who pass the examinations i suppose replied kochub y 
crossing his legs and glancing round 

 well i have pry nichnikov serving under me a splendid man a
priceless man but he s sixty is he to go up for examination 

 yes that s a difficulty as education is not at all general 
but 

count kochub y did not finish he rose took prince andrew by the arm 
and went to meet a tall bald fair man of about forty with a large open
forehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar whiteness who was
just entering the newcomer wore a blue swallow tail coat with a
cross suspended from his neck and a star on his left breast it was
sper nski prince andrew recognized him at once and felt a throb
within him as happens at critical moments of life whether it was from
respect envy or anticipation he did not know sper nski s whole
figure was of a peculiar type that made him easily recognizable in
the society in which prince andrew lived he had never seen anyone who
together with awkward and clumsy gestures possessed such calmness and
self assurance he had never seen so resolute yet gentle an expression
as that in those half closed rather humid eyes or so firm a smile that
expressed nothing nor had he heard such a refined smooth soft
voice above all he had never seen such delicate whiteness of face or
hands hands which were broad but very plump soft and white such
whiteness and softness prince andrew had only seen on the faces of
soldiers who had been long in hospital this was sper nski secretary
of state reporter to the emperor and his companion at erfurt where he
had more than once met and talked with napoleon 

sper nski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as people
involuntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hurry to
speak he spoke slowly with assurance that he would be listened to and
he looked only at the person with whom he was conversing 

prince andrew followed sper nski s every word and movement with
particular attention as happens to some people especially to men
who judge those near to them severely he always on meeting
anyone new especially anyone whom like sper nski he knew by
reputation expected to discover in him the perfection of human
qualities 

sper nski told kochub y he was sorry he had been unable to come sooner
as he had been detained at the palace he did not say that the emperor
had kept him and prince andrew noticed this affectation of modesty 
when kochub y introduced prince andrew sper nski slowly turned
his eyes to bolk nski with his customary smile and looked at him in
silence 

 i am very glad to make your acquaintance i had heard of you as
everyone has he said after a pause 

kochub y said a few words about the reception arakch ev had given
bolk nski sper nski smiled more markedly 

 the chairman of the committee on army regulations is my good friend
monsieur magn tski he said fully articulating every word and
syllable and if you like i can put you in touch with him he
paused at the full stop i hope you will find him sympathetic and
ready to co operate in promoting all that is reasonable 

a circle soon formed round sper nski and the old man who had talked
about his subordinate pry nichnikov addressed a question to him 

prince andrew without joining in the conversation watched every movement
of sper nski s this man not long since an insignificant divinity
student who now bolk nski thought held in his hands those plump
white hands the fate of russia prince andrew was struck by the
extraordinarily disdainful composure with which sper nski answered
the old man he appeared to address condescending words to him from
an immeasurable height when the old man began to speak too loud 
sper nski smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or
disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign 

having talked for a little while in the general circle sper nski rose
and coming up to prince andrew took him along to the other end of the
room it was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in
bolk nski 

 i had no chance to talk with you prince during the animated
conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me he said
with a mildly contemptuous smile as if intimating by that smile that he
and prince andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom
he had just been talking this flattered prince andrew i have known
of you for a long time first from your action with regard to your
serfs a first example of which it is very desirable that there should
be more imitators and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen
of the chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new
decree concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers which is causing so
much gossip and tittle tattle 

 no said prince andrew my father did not wish me to take
advantage of the privilege i began the service from the lower grade 

 your father a man of the last century evidently stands above our
contemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely re establishes
natural justice 

 i think however that these condemnations have some ground 
returned prince andrew trying to resist sper nski s influence of
which he began to be conscious he did not like to agree with him in
everything and felt a wish to contradict though he usually spoke easily
and well he felt a difficulty in expressing himself now while talking
with sper nski he was too much absorbed in observing the famous
man s personality 

 grounds of personal ambition maybe sper nski put in quietly 

 and of state interest to some extent said prince andrew 

 what do you mean asked sper nski quietly lowering his eyes 

 i am an admirer of montesquieu replied prince andrew and
his idea that le principe des monarchies est l honneur me para t
incontestable certains droits et privil ges de la noblesse me
paraissent tre des moyens de soutenir ce sentiment 

 the principle of monarchies is honor seems to me
 incontestable certain rights and privileges for the
 aristocracy appear to me a means of maintaining that
 sentiment 


the smile vanished from sper nski s white face which was much
improved by the change probably prince andrew s thought interested
him 

 si vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue he began 
pronouncing french with evident difficulty and speaking even slower
than in russian but quite calmly 

 if you regard the question from that point of view 


sper nski went on to say that honor l honneur cannot be upheld by
privileges harmful to the service that honor l honneur is either a
negative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a source of
emulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards which recognize it 
his arguments were concise simple and clear 

 an institution upholding honor the source of emulation is one
similar to the l gion d honneur of the great emperor napoleon not
harmful but helpful to the success of the service but not a class or
court privilege 

 i do not dispute that but it cannot be denied that court privileges
have attained the same end returned prince andrew every courtier
considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily 

 yet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege prince 
said sper nski indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably
an argument which was embarrassing for his companion if you will
do me the honor of calling on me on wednesday he added i will 
after talking with magn tski let you know what may interest you and
shall also have the pleasure of a more detailed chat with you 

closing his eyes he bowed la fran aise without taking leave and
trying to attract as little attention as possible he left the room 





chapter vi

during the first weeks of his stay in petersburg prince andrew felt the
whole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quite
overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that city 

on returning home in the evening he would jot down in his notebook four
or five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours the mechanism
of life the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhere 
absorbed the greater part of his vital energy he did nothing did
not even think or find time to think but only talked and talked
successfully of what he had thought while in the country 

he sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the same
remark on the same day in different circles but he was so busy for
whole days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking
of nothing 

as he had done on their first meeting at kochub y s sper nski
produced a strong impression on prince andrew on the wednesday when he
received him t te t te at his own house and talked to him long and
confidentially 

to bolk nski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant
creatures and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of that
perfection toward which he strove that he readily believed that in
sper nski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous
man had sper nski sprung from the same class as himself and possessed
the same breeding and traditions bolk nski would soon have discovered
his weak human unheroic sides but as it was sper nski s strange
and logical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the more because
he did not quite understand him moreover sper nski either because he
appreciated the other s capacity or because he considered it necessary
to win him to his side showed off his dispassionate calm reasonableness
before prince andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which
goes hand in hand with self assurance and consists in a tacit assumption
that one s companion is the only man besides oneself capable of
understanding the folly of the rest of mankind and the reasonableness
and profundity of one s own ideas 

during their long conversation on wednesday evening sper nski more
than once remarked we regard everything that is above the common
level of rooted custom or with a smile but we want the wolves
to be fed and the sheep to be safe or they cannot understand
this and all in a way that seemed to say we you and i 
understand what they are and who we are 

this first long conversation with sper nski only strengthened in prince
andrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first meeting 
he saw in him a remarkable clear thinking man of vast intellect who by
his energy and persistence had attained power which he was using solely
for the welfare of russia in prince andrew s eyes sper nski was the
man he would himself have wished to be one who explained all the facts
of life reasonably considered important only what was rational and
was capable of applying the standard of reason to everything everything
seemed so simple and clear in sper nski s exposition that prince
andrew involuntarily agreed with him about everything if he replied and
argued it was only because he wished to maintain his independence and
not submit to sper nski s opinions entirely everything was right
and everything was as it should be only one thing disconcerted prince
andrew this was sper nski s cold mirrorlike look which did not
allow one to penetrate to his soul and his delicate white hands which
prince andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the hands of
those who possess power this mirrorlike gaze and those delicate hands
irritated prince andrew he knew not why he was unpleasantly
struck too by the excessive contempt for others that he observed in
sper nski and by the diversity of lines of argument he used to
support his opinions he made use of every kind of mental device except
analogy and passed too boldly it seemed to prince andrew from one
to another now he would take up the position of a practical man and
condemn dreamers now that of a satirist and laugh ironically at his
opponents now grow severely logical or suddenly rise to the realm of
metaphysics this last resource was one he very frequently employed 
he would transfer a question to metaphysical heights pass on to
definitions of space time and thought and having deduced the
refutation he needed would again descend to the level of the original
discussion 

in general the trait of sper nski s mentality which struck prince
andrew most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and
authority of reason it was evident that the thought could never occur
to him which to prince andrew seemed so natural namely that it is
after all impossible to express all one thinks and that he had never
felt the doubt is not all i think and believe nonsense and
it was just this peculiarity of sper nski s mind that particularly
attracted prince andrew 

during the first period of their acquaintance bolk nski felt a
passionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt for
bonaparte the fact that sper nski was the son of a village priest 
and that stupid people might meanly despise him on account of his
humble origin as in fact many did caused prince andrew to cherish his
sentiment for him the more and unconsciously to strengthen it 

on that first evening bolk nski spent with him having mentioned the
commission for the revision of the code of laws sper nski told him
sarcastically that the commission had existed for a hundred and fifty
years had cost millions and had done nothing except that rosenkampf
had stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the different codes 

 and that is all the state has for the millions it has spent said
he we want to give the senate new juridical powers but we have no
laws that is why it is a sin for men like you prince not to serve in
these times 

prince andrew said that for that work an education in jurisprudence was
needed which he did not possess 

 but nobody possesses it so what would you have it is a vicious
circle from which we must break a way out 

a week later prince andrew was a member of the committee on army
regulations and what he had not at all expected was chairman of a
section of the committee for the revision of the laws at sper nski s
request he took the first part of the civil code that was being drawn up
and with the aid of the code napol on and the institutes of justinian 
he worked at formulating the section on personal rights 





chapter vii

nearly two years before this in 1808 pierre on returning to petersburg
after visiting his estates had involuntarily found himself in a leading
position among the petersburg freemasons he arranged dining and funeral
lodge meetings enrolled new members and busied himself uniting various
lodges and acquiring authentic charters he gave money for the erection
of temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of alms 
in regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular 
he supported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in
petersburg 

his life meanwhile continued as before with the same infatuations and
dissipations he liked to dine and drink well and though he considered
it immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations of the
bachelor circles in which he moved 

amid the turmoil of his activities and distractions however pierre at
the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to rest
upon it the more masonic ground on which he stood gave way under him 
at the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the
closer bound he involuntarily became to the order when he had joined
the freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who confidently
steps onto the smooth surface of a bog when he put his foot down it
sank in to make quite sure of the firmness of the ground he put
his other foot down and sank deeper still became stuck in it and
involuntarily waded knee deep in the bog 

joseph alex evich was not in petersburg he had of late stood aside
from the affairs of the petersburg lodges and lived almost entirely in
moscow all the members of the lodges were men pierre knew in ordinary
life and it was difficult for him to regard them merely as brothers in
freemasonry and not as prince b or iv n vas levich d whom he knew
in society mostly as weak and insignificant men under the masonic
aprons and insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at which they
aimed in ordinary life often after collecting alms and reckoning up
twenty to thirty rubles received for the most part in promises from a
dozen members of whom half were as well able to pay as himself pierre
remembered the masonic vow in which each brother promised to devote
all his belongings to his neighbor and doubts on which he tried not to
dwell arose in his soul 

he divided the brothers he knew into four categories in the first he
put those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodges
or in human affairs but were exclusively occupied with the mystical
science of the order with questions of the threefold designation of
god the three primordial elements sulphur mercury and salt or
the meaning of the square and all the various figures of the temple of
solomon pierre respected this class of brothers to which the elder ones
chiefly belonged including pierre thought joseph alex evich himself 
but he did not share their interests his heart was not in the mystical
aspect of freemasonry 

in the second category pierre reckoned himself and others like him 
seeking and vacillating who had not yet found in freemasonry a straight
and comprehensible path but hoped to do so 

in the third category he included those brothers the majority who saw
nothing in freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies and prized
the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their
purport or significance such were willarski and even the grand master
of the principal lodge 

finally to the fourth category also a great many brothers belonged 
particularly those who had lately joined these according to pierre s
observations were men who had no belief in anything nor desire for
anything but joined the freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy
young brothers who were influential through their connections or rank 
and of whom there were very many in the lodge 

pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing freemasonry 
at any rate as he saw it here sometimes seemed to him based merely
on externals he did not think of doubting freemasonry itself but
suspected that russian masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated
from its original principles and so toward the end of the year he went
abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the order 

in the summer of 1809 pierre returned to petersburg our freemasons knew
from correspondence with those abroad that bez khov had obtained the
confidence of many highly placed persons had been initiated into many
mysteries had been raised to a higher grade and was bringing back with
him much that might conduce to the advantage of the masonic cause
in russia the petersburg freemasons all came to see him tried to
ingratiate themselves with him and it seemed to them all that he was
preparing something for them and concealing it 

a solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened at
which pierre promised to communicate to the petersburg brothers what
he had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their order the
meeting was a full one after the usual ceremonies pierre rose and began
his address 

 dear brothers he began blushing and stammering with a written
speech in his hand it is not sufficient to observe our mysteries in
the seclusion of our lodge we must act act we are drowsing but we
must act pierre raised his notebook and began to read 

 for the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph of
virtue he read we must cleanse men from prejudice diffuse
principles in harmony with the spirit of the times undertake the
education of the young unite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with the
wisest men boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions infidelity and
folly and form of those devoted to us a body linked together by unity
of purpose and possessed of authority and power 

 to attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over vice
and must endeavor to secure that the honest man may even in this world 
receive a lasting reward for his virtue but in these great endeavors we
are gravely hampered by the political institutions of today what is
to be done in these circumstances to favor revolutions overthrow
everything repel force by force no we are very far from that 
every violent reform deserves censure for it quite fails to remedy
evil while men remain what they are and also because wisdom needs no
violence 

 the whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of
preparing men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of
conviction aiming at the punishment of vice and folly and patronizing
talent and virtue raising worthy men from the dust and attaching
them to our brotherhood only then will our order have the power
unobtrusively to bind the hands of the protectors of disorder and to
control them without their being aware of it in a word we must found a
form of government holding universal sway which should be diffused over
the whole world without destroying the bonds of citizenship and beside
which all other governments can continue in their customary course and
do everything except what impedes the great aim of our order which
is to obtain for virtue the victory over vice this aim was that of
christianity itself it taught men to be wise and good and for their
own benefit to follow the example and instruction of the best and wisest
men 

 at that time when everything was plunged in darkness preaching
alone was of course sufficient the novelty of truth endowed her with
special strength but now we need much more powerful methods it is
now necessary that man governed by his senses should find in virtue
a charm palpable to those senses it is impossible to eradicate the
passions but we must strive to direct them to a noble aim and it is
therefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his passions
within the limits of virtue our order should provide means to that end 

 as soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state 
each of them again training two others and all being closely united 
everything will be possible for our order which has already in secret
accomplished much for the welfare of mankind 

this speech not only made a strong impression but created excitement in
the lodge the majority of the brothers seeing in it dangerous designs
of illuminism met it with a coldness that surprised pierre the grand
master began answering him and pierre began developing his views with
more and more warmth it was long since there had been so stormy a
meeting parties were formed some accusing pierre of illuminism others
supporting him at that meeting he was struck for the first time by
the endless variety of men s minds which prevents a truth from ever
presenting itself identically to two persons even those members
who seemed to be on his side understood him in their own way with
limitations and alterations he could not agree to as what he always
wanted most was to convey his thought to others just as he himself
understood it 

 the illuminati sought to substitute republican for
 monarchical institutions 

at the end of the meeting the grand master with irony and ill will
reproved bez khov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue
alone but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute 
pierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would
be accepted he was told that it would not and without waiting for the
usual formalities he left the lodge and went home 





chapter viii

again pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded for three
days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa at
home receiving no one and going nowhere 

it was just then that he received a letter from his wife who implored
him to see her telling him how grieved she was about him and how she
wished to devote her whole life to him 

at the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she would
return to petersburg from abroad 

following this letter one of the masonic brothers whom pierre respected
less than the others forced his way in to see him and turning the
conversation upon pierre s matrimonial affairs by way of fraternal
advice expressed the opinion that his severity to his wife was wrong
and that he was neglecting one of the first rules of freemasonry by not
forgiving the penitent 

at the same time his mother in law prince vas li s wife sent to
him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most
important matter pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and
that they wanted to reunite him with his wife and in the mood he then
was this was not even unpleasant to him nothing mattered to him 
nothing in life seemed to him of much importance and under the
influence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither his
liberty nor his resolution to punish his wife 

 no one is right and no one is to blame so she too is not to
blame he thought 

if he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife it
was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take
any step had his wife come to him he would not have turned her away 
compared to what preoccupied him was it not a matter of indifference
whether he lived with his wife or not 

without replying either to his wife or his mother in law pierre late
one night prepared for a journey and started for moscow to see joseph
alex evich this is what he noted in his diary 

moscow 17th november

i have just returned from my benefactor and hasten to write down what i
have experienced joseph alex evich is living poorly and has for three
years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder no one has
ever heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint from morning till
late at night except when he eats his very plain food he is working
at science he received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed
on which he lay i made the sign of the knights of the east and of
jerusalem and he responded in the same manner asking me with a mild
smile what i had learned and gained in the prussian and scottish lodges 
i told him everything as best i could and told him what i had proposed
to our petersburg lodge of the bad reception i had encountered and of
my rupture with the brothers joseph alex evich having remained silent
and thoughtful for a good while told me his view of the matter which
at once lit up for me my whole past and the future path i should follow 
he surprised me by asking whether i remembered the threefold aim of
the order 1 the preservation and study of the mystery 2 the
purification and reformation of oneself for its reception and 3 the
improvement of the human race by striving for such purification which
is the principal aim of these three certainly self reformation and
self purification only to this aim can we always strive independently
of circumstances but at the same time just this aim demands the
greatest efforts of us and so led astray by pride losing sight of
this aim we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our
impurity we are unworthy to receive or seek the reformation of
the human race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and
profligacy illuminism is not a pure doctrine just because it is
attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride on this ground
joseph alex evich condemned my speech and my whole activity and in the
depth of my soul i agreed with him talking of my family affairs he said
to me the chief duty of a true mason as i have told you lies in
perfecting himself we often think that by removing all the difficulties
of our life we shall more quickly reach our aim but on the contrary 
my dear sir it is only in the midst of worldly cares that we can attain
our three chief aims 1 self knowledge for man can only know himself
by comparison 2 self perfecting which can only be attained by
conflict and 3 the attainment of the chief virtue love of death 
only the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and develop our
innate love of death or of rebirth to a new life these words are all
the more remarkable because in spite of his great physical sufferings 
joseph alex evich is never weary of life though he loves death for
which in spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner man he does
not yet feel himself sufficiently prepared my benefactor then explained
to me fully the meaning of the great square of creation and pointed out
to me that the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything he
advised me not to avoid intercourse with the petersburg brothers but
to take up only second grade posts in the lodge to try while
diverting the brothers from pride to turn them toward the true path
self knowledge and self perfecting besides this he advised me for
myself personally above all to keep a watch over myself and to that end
he gave me a notebook the one i am now writing in and in which i will
in future note down all my actions 

petersburg 23rd november

i am again living with my wife my mother in law came to me in tears and
said that h l ne was here and that she implored me to hear her that
she was innocent and unhappy at my desertion and much more i knew
that if i once let myself see her i should not have strength to go on
refusing what she wanted in my perplexity i did not know whose aid and
advice to seek had my benefactor been here he would have told me what
to do i went to my room and reread joseph alex evich s letters and
recalled my conversations with him and deduced from it all that i
ought not to refuse a supplicant and ought to reach a helping hand to
everyone especially to one so closely bound to me and that i must
bear my cross but if i forgive her for the sake of doing right then
let union with her have only a spiritual aim that is what i decided 
and what i wrote to joseph alex evich i told my wife that i begged her
to forget the past to forgive me whatever wrong i may have done her 
and that i had nothing to forgive it gave me joy to tell her this she
need not know how hard it was for me to see her again i have settled on
the upper floor of this big house and am experiencing a happy feeling of
regeneration 





chapter ix

at that time as always happens the highest society that met at court
and at the grand balls was divided into several circles each with its
own particular tone the largest of these was the french circle of the
napoleonic alliance the circle of count rumy ntsev and caulaincourt 
in this group h l ne as soon as she had settled in petersburg with
her husband took a very prominent place she was visited by the members
of the french embassy and by many belonging to that circle and noted for
their intellect and polished manners 

h l ne had been at erfurt during the famous meeting of the emperors
and had brought from there these connections with the napoleonic
notabilities at erfurt her success had been brilliant napoleon himself
had noticed her in the theater and said of her c est un superbe
animal her success as a beautiful and elegant woman did not
surprise pierre for she had become even handsomer than before what did
surprise him was that during these last two years his wife had succeeded
in gaining the reputation d une femme charmante aussi spirituelle
que belle 2 the distinguished prince de ligne wrote her
eight page letters bil bin saved up his epigrams to produce them
in countess bez khova s presence to be received in the countess
bez khova s salon was regarded as a diploma of intellect young men
read books before attending h l ne s evenings to have something to
say in her salon and secretaries of the embassy and even ambassadors 
confided diplomatic secrets to her so that in a way h l ne was a
power pierre who knew she was very stupid sometimes attended with a
strange feeling of perplexity and fear her evenings and dinner parties 
where politics poetry and philosophy were discussed at these parties
his feelings were like those of a conjuror who always expects his trick
to be found out at any moment but whether because stupidity was just
what was needed to run such a salon or because those who were deceived
found pleasure in the deception at any rate it remained unexposed and
h l ne bez khova s reputation as a lovely and clever woman became
so firmly established that she could say the emptiest and stupidest
things and everybody would go into raptures over every word of hers
and look for a profound meaning in it of which she herself had no
conception 

 that s a superb animal 

 2 of a charming woman as witty as she is lovely 


pierre was just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman he was
that absent minded crank a grand seigneur husband who was in no one s
way and far from spoiling the high tone and general impression of the
drawing room he served by the contrast he presented to her as an
advantageous background to his elegant and tactful wife pierre during
the last two years as a result of his continual absorption in abstract
interests and his sincere contempt for all else had acquired in his
wife s circle which did not interest him that air of unconcern 
indifference and benevolence toward all which cannot be acquired
artificially and therefore inspires involuntary respect he entered
his wife s drawing room as one enters a theater was acquainted with
everybody equally pleased to see everyone and equally indifferent to
them all sometimes he joined in a conversation which interested him
and regardless of whether any gentlemen of the embassy were
present or not lispingly expressed his views which were sometimes not
at all in accord with the accepted tone of the moment but the general
opinion concerning the queer husband of the most distinguished woman
in petersburg was so well established that no one took his freaks
seriously 

among the many young men who frequented her house every day bor s
drubetsk y who had already achieved great success in the service was
the most intimate friend of the bez khov household since h l ne s
return from erfurt h l ne spoke of him as mon page and treated
him like a child her smile for him was the same as for everybody 
but sometimes that smile made pierre uncomfortable toward him bor s
behaved with a particularly dignified and sad deference this shade
of deference also disturbed pierre he had suffered so painfully three
years before from the mortification to which his wife had subjected him
that he now protected himself from the danger of its repetition first
by not being a husband to his wife and secondly by not allowing himself
to suspect 

 no now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally renounced
her former infatuations he told himself there has never been
an instance of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs of the
heart a statement which though gathered from an unknown source 
he believed implicitly yet strange to say bor s presence in his
wife s drawing room and he was almost always there had a physical
effect upon pierre it constricted his limbs and destroyed the
unconsciousness and freedom of his movements 

 what a strange antipathy thought pierre yet i used to like
him very much 

in the eyes of the world pierre was a great gentleman the rather blind
and absurd husband of a distinguished wife a clever crank who did
nothing but harmed nobody and was a first rate good natured fellow but
a complex and difficult process of internal development was taking place
all this time in pierre s soul revealing much to him and causing him
many spiritual doubts and joys 





chapter x

pierre went on with his diary and this is what he wrote in it during
that time 


24th november

got up at eight read the scriptures then went to my duties by joseph
alex evich s advice pierre had entered the service of the state and
served on one of the committees returned home for dinner and dined
alone the countess had many visitors i do not like i ate and drank
moderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the brothers 
in the evening i went down to the countess and told a funny story about
b and only remembered that i ought not to have done so when everybody
laughed loudly at it 

i am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind great god help me to
walk in thy paths 1 to conquer anger by calmness and deliberation 
 2 to vanquish lust by self restraint and repulsion 3 to withdraw
from worldliness but not avoid a the service of the state b family
duties c relations with my friends and the management of my affairs 


27th november

i got up late on waking i lay long in bed yielding to sloth o god 
help and strengthen me that i may walk in thy ways read the scriptures 
but without proper feeling brother ur sov came and we talked about
worldly vanities he told me of the emperor s new projects i began
to criticize them but remembered my rules and my benefactor s
words that a true freemason should be a zealous worker for the state
when his aid is required and a quiet onlooker when not called on to
assist my tongue is my enemy brothers g v and o visited me and we
had a preliminary talk about the reception of a new brother they laid
on me the duty of rhetor i feel myself weak and unworthy then our
talk turned to the interpretation of the seven pillars and steps of the
temple the seven sciences the seven virtues the seven vices and the
seven gifts of the holy spirit brother o was very eloquent in the
evening the admission took place the new decoration of the premises
contributed much to the magnificence of the spectacle it was bor s
drubetsk y who was admitted i nominated him and was the rhetor a
strange feeling agitated me all the time i was alone with him in the
dark chamber i caught myself harboring a feeling of hatred toward him
which i vainly tried to overcome that is why i should really like
to save him from evil and lead him into the path of truth but evil
thoughts of him did not leave me it seemed to me that his object in
entering the brotherhood was merely to be intimate and in favor with
members of our lodge apart from the fact that he had asked me several
times whether n and s were members of our lodge a question to which i
could not reply and that according to my observation he is incapable of
feeling respect for our holy order and is too preoccupied and satisfied
with the outer man to desire spiritual improvement i had no cause to
doubt him but he seemed to me insincere and all the time i stood
alone with him in the dark temple it seemed to me that he was smiling
contemptuously at my words and i wished really to stab his bare breast
with the sword i held to it i could not be eloquent nor could i
frankly mention my doubts to the brothers and to the grand master great
architect of nature help me to find the true path out of the labyrinth
of lies 


after this three pages were left blank in the diary and then the
following was written 


i have had a long and instructive talk alone with brother v who
advised me to hold fast by brother a though i am unworthy much was
revealed to me adonai is the name of the creator of the world elohim
is the name of the ruler of all the third name is the name unutterable
which means the all talks with brother v strengthen refresh and
support me in the path of virtue in his presence doubt has no place 
the distinction between the poor teachings of mundane science and our
sacred all embracing teaching is clear to me human sciences dissect
everything to comprehend it and kill everything to examine it in the
holy science of our order all is one all is known in its entirety and
life the trinity the three elements of matter are sulphur mercury 
and salt sulphur is of an oily and fiery nature in combination with
salt by its fiery nature it arouses a desire in the latter by means
of which it attracts mercury seizes it holds it and in combination
produces other bodies mercury is a fluid volatile spiritual essence 
christ the holy spirit him 


3rd december

awoke late read the scriptures but was apathetic afterwards went and
paced up and down the large hall i wished to meditate but instead my
imagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago when d lokhov 
meeting me in moscow after our duel said he hoped i was enjoying
perfect peace of mind in spite of my wife s absence at the time i
gave him no answer now i recalled every detail of that meeting and in
my mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter replies i recollected
myself and drove away that thought only when i found myself glowing with
anger but i did not sufficiently repent afterwards bor s drubetsk y
came and began relating various adventures his coming vexed me from the
first and i said something disagreeable to him he replied i flared
up and said much that was unpleasant and even rude to him he became
silent and i recollected myself only when it was too late my god i
cannot get on with him at all the cause of this is my egotism i set
myself above him and so become much worse than he for he is lenient
to my rudeness while i on the contrary nourish contempt for him o god 
grant that in his presence i may rather see my own vileness and behave
so that he too may benefit after dinner i fell asleep and as i was
drowsing off i clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear thy
day 

i dreamed that i was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded by
dogs but i went on undismayed suddenly a smallish dog seized my left
thigh with its teeth and would not let go i began to throttle it with
my hands scarcely had i torn it off before another a bigger one began
biting me i lifted it up but the higher i lifted it the bigger and
heavier it grew and suddenly brother a came and taking my arm led
me to a building to enter which we had to pass along a narrow plank 
i stepped on it but it bent and gave way and i began to clamber up a
fence which i could scarcely reach with my hands after much effort i
dragged myself up so that my leg hung down on one side and my body on
the other i looked round and saw brother a standing on the fence and
pointing me to a broad avenue and garden and in the garden was a large
and beautiful building i woke up o lord great architect of nature 
help me to tear from myself these dogs my passions especially the
last which unites in itself the strength of all the former ones and
aid me to enter that temple of virtue to a vision of which i attained in
my dream 


7th december

i dreamed that joseph alex evich was sitting in my house and that i
was very glad and wished to entertain him it seemed as if i chattered
incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this could
not please him and i wished to come close to him and embrace him but
as soon as i drew near i saw that his face had changed and grown young 
and he was quietly telling me something about the teaching of our order 
but so softly that i could not hear it then it seemed that we all left
the room and something strange happened we were sitting or lying on
the floor he was telling me something and i wished to show him my
sensibility and not listening to what he was saying i began picturing
to myself the condition of my inner man and the grace of god sanctifying
me and tears came into my eyes and i was glad he noticed this but he
looked at me with vexation and jumped up breaking off his remarks i
felt abashed and asked whether what he had been saying did not concern
me but he did not reply gave me a kind look and then we suddenly
found ourselves in my bedroom where there is a double bed he lay down
on the edge of it and i burned with longing to caress him and lie down
too and he said tell me frankly what is your chief temptation do
you know it i think you know it already abashed by this question 
i replied that sloth was my chief temptation he shook his head
incredulously and even more abashed i said that though i was living
with my wife as he advised i was not living with her as her husband to
this he replied that one should not deprive a wife of one s embraces
and gave me to understand that that was my duty but i replied that
i should be ashamed to do it and suddenly everything vanished and i
awoke and found in my mind the text from the gospel the life was
the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness
comprehended it not joseph alex evich s face had looked young
and bright that day i received a letter from my benefactor in which he
wrote about conjugal duties 


9th december

i had a dream from which i awoke with a throbbing heart i saw that
i was in moscow in my house in the big sitting room and joseph
alex evich came in from the drawing room i seemed to know at once that
the process of regeneration had already taken place in him and i rushed
to meet him i embraced him and kissed his hands and he said hast
thou noticed that my face is different i looked at him still
holding him in my arms and saw that his face was young but that he
had no hair on his head and his features were quite changed and i said 
 i should have known you had i met you by chance and i thought to
myself am i telling the truth and suddenly i saw him lying like
a dead body then he gradually recovered and went with me into my study
carrying a large book of sheets of drawing paper i said i drew
that and he answered by bowing his head i opened the book and on
all the pages there were excellent drawings and in my dream i knew
that these drawings represented the love adventures of the soul with its
beloved and on its pages i saw a beautiful representation of a maiden
in transparent garments and with a transparent body flying up to the
clouds and i seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than a
representation of the song of songs and looking at those drawings i
dreamed i felt that i was doing wrong but could not tear myself away
from them lord help me my god if thy forsaking me is thy doing thy
will be done but if i am myself the cause teach me what i should do i
shall perish of my debauchery if thou utterly desertest me 





chapter xi

the rost vs monetary affairs had not improved during the two years
they had spent in the country 

though nicholas rost v had kept firmly to his resolution and was still
serving modestly in an obscure regiment spending comparatively little 
the way of life at otr dnoe m tenka s management of affairs in
particular was such that the debts inevitably increased every year 
the only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to
apply for an official post so he had come to petersburg to look for one
and also as he said to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last
time 

soon after their arrival in petersburg berg proposed to v ra and was
accepted 

though in moscow the rost vs belonged to the best society without
themselves giving it a thought yet in petersburg their circle of
acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one in petersburg they were
provincials and the very people they had entertained in moscow without
inquiring to what set they belonged here looked down on them 

the rost vs lived in the same hospitable way in petersburg as in
moscow and the most diverse people met at their suppers country
neighbors from otr dnoe impoverished old squires and their daughters 
per nskaya a maid of honor pierre bez khov and the son of their
district postmaster who had obtained a post in petersburg among the
men who very soon became frequent visitors at the rost vs house in
petersburg were bor s pierre whom the count had met in the street and
dragged home with him and berg who spent whole days at the rost vs 
and paid the eldest daughter countess v ra the attentions a young man
pays when he intends to propose 

not in vain had berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at
austerlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left he
narrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air that
everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed and he had
obtained two decorations for austerlitz 

in the finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself he had picked
up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aide de camp standing near
the commander in chief and had taken it to his commander just as he had
done after austerlitz he related this occurrence at such length and
so insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do
this and he received two decorations for the finnish war also in
1809 he was a captain in the guards wore medals and held some special
lucrative posts in petersburg 

though some skeptics smiled when told of berg s merits it could not
be denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer on excellent
terms with his superiors and a moral young man with a brilliant career
before him and an assured position in society 

four years before meeting a german comrade in the stalls of a moscow
theater berg had pointed out v ra rost va to him and had said in
german das soll mein weib werden and from that moment had
made up his mind to marry her now in petersburg having considered the
rost vs position and his own he decided that the time had come to
propose 

 that girl shall be my wife 


berg s proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not
flattering to him at first it seemed strange that the son of an obscure
livonian gentleman should propose marriage to a countess rost va but
berg s chief characteristic was such a na ve and good natured egotism
that the rost vs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thing 
since he himself was so firmly convinced that it was good indeed
excellent moreover the rost vs affairs were seriously embarrassed 
as the suitor could not but know and above all v ra was twenty four 
had been taken out everywhere and though she was certainly good looking
and sensible no one up to now had proposed to her so they gave their
consent 

 you see said berg to his comrade whom he called friend 
only because he knew that everyone has friends you see i have
considered it all and should not marry if i had not thought it all out
or if it were in any way unsuitable but on the contrary my papa and
mamma are now provided for i have arranged that rent for them in the
baltic provinces and i can live in petersburg on my pay and with
her fortune and my good management we can get along nicely i am not
marrying for money i consider that dishonorable but a wife should
bring her share and a husband his i have my position in the service 
she has connections and some means in our times that is worth
something isn t it but above all she is a handsome estimable girl 
and she loves me 

berg blushed and smiled 

 and i love her because her character is sensible and very good 
now the other sister though they are the same family is quite
different an unpleasant character and has not the same intelligence 
she is so you know unpleasant but my fianc e well you
will be coming he was going to say to dine but changed his
mind and said to take tea with us and quickly doubling up his
tongue he blew a small round ring of tobacco smoke perfectly embodying
his dream of happiness 

after the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by berg s
proposal the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times took
possession of the family but the rejoicing was external and insincere 
in the family s feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness
and constraint was evident as if they were ashamed of not having loved
v ra sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands the
old count felt this most he would probably have been unable to state
the cause of his embarrassment but it resulted from the state of his
affairs he did not know at all how much he had what his debts amounted
to or what dowry he could give v ra when his daughters were born
he had assigned to each of them for her dowry an estate with three
hundred serfs but one of these estates had already been sold and the
other was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it would
have to be sold so that it was impossible to give it to v ra nor had
he any money 

berg had already been engaged a month and only a week remained before
the wedding but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the
question of the dowry nor spoken to his wife about it at one time the
count thought of giving her the ryaz n estate or of selling a forest 
at another time of borrowing money on a note of hand a few days before
the wedding berg entered the count s study early one morning and with
a pleasant smile respectfully asked his future father in law to let
him know what v ra s dowry would be the count was so disconcerted by
this long foreseen inquiry that without consideration he gave the first
reply that came into his head i like your being businesslike about
it i like it you shall be satisfied 

and patting berg on the shoulder he got up wishing to end the
conversation but berg smiling pleasantly explained that if he did not
know for certain how much v ra would have and did not receive at least
part of the dowry in advance he would have to break matters off 

 because consider count if i allowed myself to marry now
without having definite means to maintain my wife i should be acting
badly 

the conversation ended by the count who wished to be generous and to
avoid further importunity saying that he would give a note of hand
for eighty thousand rubles berg smiled meekly kissed the count on the
shoulder and said that he was very grateful but that it was impossible
for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand in
ready money or at least twenty thousand count he added and
then a note of hand for only sixty thousand 

 yes yes all right said the count hurriedly only excuse me 
my dear fellow i ll give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for
eighty thousand as well yes yes kiss me 





chapter xii

nat sha was sixteen and it was the year 1809 the very year to which
she had counted on her fingers with bor s after they had kissed four
years ago since then she had not seen him before s nya and her
mother if bor s happened to be mentioned she spoke quite freely of
that episode as of some childish long forgotten matter that was not
worth mentioning but in the secret depths of her soul the question
whether her engagement to bor s was a jest or an important binding
promise tormented her 

since bor s left moscow in 1805 to join the army he had not seen the
rost vs he had been in moscow several times and had passed near
otr dnoe but had never been to see them 

sometimes it occurred to nat sha that he did not wish to see her and
this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spoke
of him 

 nowadays old friends are not remembered the countess would say
when bor s was mentioned 

anna mikh ylovna also had of late visited them less frequently seemed
to hold herself with particular dignity and always spoke rapturously
and gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on
which he had entered when the rost vs came to petersburg bor s called
on them 

he drove to their house in some agitation the memory of nat sha was
his most poetic recollection but he went with the firm intention of
letting her and her parents feel that the childish relations between
himself and nat sha could not be binding either on her or on him he
had a brilliant position in society thanks to his intimacy with countess
bez khova a brilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage
of an important personage whose complete confidence he enjoyed and he
was beginning to make plans for marrying one of the richest heiresses in
petersburg plans which might very easily be realized when he entered
the rost vs drawing room nat sha was in her own room when she
heard of his arrival she almost ran into the drawing room flushed and
beaming with a more than cordial smile 

bor s remembered nat sha in a short dress with dark eyes shining from
under her curls and boisterous childish laughter as he had known her
four years before and so he was taken aback when quite a different
nat sha entered and his face expressed rapturous astonishment this
expression on his face pleased nat sha 

 well do you recognize your little madcap playmate asked the
countess 

bor s kissed nat sha s hand and said that he was astonished at the
change in her 

 how handsome you have grown 

 i should think so replied nat sha s laughing eyes 

 and is papa older she asked 

nat sha sat down and without joining in bor s conversation with
the countess silently and minutely studied her childhood s suitor he
felt the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced
at her occasionally 

bor s uniform spurs tie and the way his hair was brushed were all
comme il faut and in the latest fashion this nat sha noticed at once 
he sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess arranging
with his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his left hand
like a skin and he spoke with a particularly refined compression of his
lips about the amusements of the highest petersburg society recalling
with mild irony old times in moscow and moscow acquaintances it was
not accidentally nat sha felt that he alluded when speaking of the
highest aristocracy to an ambassador s ball he had attended and to
invitations he had received from n n and s s 

all this time nat sha sat silent glancing up at him from under her
brows this gaze disturbed and confused bor s more and more he looked
round more frequently toward her and broke off in what he was saying 
he did not stay more than ten minutes then rose and took his leave the
same inquisitive challenging and rather mocking eyes still looked
at him after his first visit bor s said to himself that nat sha
attracted him just as much as ever but that he must not yield to that
feeling because to marry her a girl almost without fortune would
mean ruin to his career while to renew their former relations without
intending to marry her would be dishonorable bor s made up his mind
to avoid meeting nat sha but despite that resolution he called again
a few days later and began calling often and spending whole days at the
rost vs it seemed to him that he ought to have an explanation with
nat sha and tell her that the old times must be forgotten that in
spite of everything she could not be his wife that he had no means 
and they would never let her marry him but he failed to do so and felt
awkward about entering on such an explanation from day to day he
became more and more entangled it seemed to her mother and s nya that
nat sha was in love with bor s as of old she sang him his favorite
songs showed him her album making him write in it did not allow him
to allude to the past letting it be understood how delightful was the
present and every day he went away in a fog without having said what
he meant to and not knowing what he was doing or why he came or how
it would all end he left off visiting h l ne and received reproachful
notes from her every day and yet he continued to spend whole days with
the rost vs 





chapter xiii

one night when the old countess in nightcap and dressing jacket 
without her false curls and with her poor little knob of hair showing
under her white cotton cap knelt sighing and groaning on a rug and
bowing to the ground in prayer her door creaked and nat sha also in
a dressing jacket with slippers on her bare feet and her hair in
curlpapers ran in the countess her prayerful mood dispelled looked
round and frowned she was finishing her last prayer can it be that
this couch will be my grave nat sha flushed and eager seeing
her mother in prayer suddenly checked her rush half sat down and
unconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding herself seeing that
her mother was still praying she ran on tiptoe to the bed and rapidly
slipping one little foot against the other pushed off her slippers and
jumped onto the bed the countess had feared might become her grave this
couch was high with a feather bed and five pillows each smaller than
the one below nat sha jumped on it sank into the feather bed rolled
over to the wall and began snuggling up the bedclothes as she settled
down raising her knees to her chin kicking out and laughing almost
inaudibly now covering herself up head and all and now peeping at her
mother the countess finished her prayers and came to the bed with a
stern face but seeing that nat sha s head was covered she smiled
in her kind weak way 

 now then now then said she 

 mamma can we have a talk yes said nat sha now just one on
your throat and another that ll do and seizing her mother round
the neck she kissed her on the throat in her behavior to her mother
nat sha seemed rough but she was so sensitive and tactful that however
she clasped her mother she always managed to do it without hurting her
or making her feel uncomfortable or displeased 

 well what is it tonight said the mother having arranged her
pillows and waited until nat sha after turning over a couple of times 
had settled down beside her under the quilt spread out her arms and
assumed a serious expression 

these visits of nat sha s at night before the count returned from his
club were one of the greatest pleasures of both mother and daughter 

 what is it tonight but i have to tell you 

nat sha put her hand on her mother s mouth 

 about bor s i know she said seriously that s what i
have come about don t say it i know no do tell me and she
removed her hand tell me mamma he s nice 

 nat sha you are sixteen at your age i was married you say bor s
is nice he is very nice and i love him like a son but what then 
what are you thinking about you have quite turned his head i can see
that 

as she said this the countess looked round at her daughter nat sha
was lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the mahogany
sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead so that the countess
only saw her daughter s face in profile that face struck her by its
peculiarly serious and concentrated expression 

nat sha was listening and considering 

 well what then said she 

 you have quite turned his head and why what do you want of him you
know you can t marry him 

 why not said nat sha without changing her position 

 because he is young because he is poor because he is a relation 
and because you yourself don t love him 

 how do you know 

 i know it is not right darling 

 but if i want to said nat sha 

 leave off talking nonsense said the countess 

 but if i want to 

 nat sha i am in earnest 

nat sha did not let her finish she drew the countess large hand to
her kissed it on the back and then on the palm then again turned it
over and began kissing first one knuckle then the space between the
knuckles then the next knuckle whispering january february 
march april may speak mamma why don t you say anything speak 
said she turning to her mother who was tenderly gazing at her daughter
and in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she had wished to
say 

 it won t do my love not everyone will understand this friendship
dating from your childish days and to see him so intimate with you may
injure you in the eyes of other young men who visit us and above all
it torments him for nothing he may already have found a suitable and
wealthy match and now he s half crazy 

 crazy repeated nat sha 

 i ll tell you some things about myself i had a cousin 

 i know cyril matv ich but he is old 

 he was not always old but this is what i ll do nat sha i ll
have a talk with bor s he need not come so often 

 why not if he likes to 

 because i know it will end in nothing 

 how can you know no mamma don t speak to him what nonsense 
said nat sha in the tone of one being deprived of her property 
 well i won t marry but let him come if he enjoys it and i enjoy
it nat sha smiled and looked at her mother not to marry but
just so she added 

 how so my pet 

 just so there s no need for me to marry him but just so 

 just so just so repeated the countess and shaking all over she
went off into a good humored unexpected elderly laugh 

 don t laugh stop cried nat sha you re shaking the whole
bed you re awfully like me just such another giggler wait 
and she seized the countess hands and kissed a knuckle of the little
finger saying june and continued kissing july august 
on the other hand but mamma is he very much in love what do you
think was anybody ever so much in love with you and he s very nice 
very very nice only not quite my taste he is so narrow like the
dining room clock don t you understand narrow you know gray 
light gray 

 what rubbish you re talking said the countess 

nat sha continued don t you really understand nicholas would
understand bez khov now is blue dark blue and red and he is
square 

 you flirt with him too said the countess laughing 

 no he is a freemason i have found out he is fine dark blue and
red how can i explain it to you 

 little countess the count s voice called from behind the door 
 you re not asleep nat sha jumped up snatched up her slippers 
and ran barefoot to her own room 

it was a long time before she could sleep she kept thinking that no one
could understand all that she understood and all there was in her 

 s nya she thought glancing at that curled up sleeping little
kitten with her enormous plait of hair no how could she she s
virtuous she fell in love with nicholas and does not wish to know
anything more even mamma does not understand it is wonderful how
clever i am and how charming she is she went on speaking
of herself in the third person and imagining it was some very wise
man the wisest and best of men who was saying it of her there
is everything everything in her continued this man she is
unusually intelligent charming and then she is pretty uncommonly
pretty and agile she swims and rides splendidly and her voice one
can really say it s a wonderful voice 

she hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by cherubini threw herself
on her bed laughed at the pleasant thought that she would immediately
fall asleep called duny sha the maid to put out the candle and before
duny sha had left the room had already passed into yet another happier
world of dreams where everything was as light and beautiful as in
reality and even more so because it was different 

next day the countess called bor s aside and had a talk with him after
which he ceased coming to the rost vs 





chapter xiv

on the thirty first of december new year s eve 1809 10 an old
grandee of catherine s day was giving a ball and midnight supper the
diplomatic corps and the emperor himself were to be present 

the grandee s well known mansion on the english quay glittered with
innumerable lights police were stationed at the brightly lit entrance
which was carpeted with red baize and not only gendarmes but dozens of
police officers and even the police master himself stood at the porch 
carriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving with red liveried
footmen and footmen in plumed hats from the carriages emerged men
wearing uniforms stars and ribbons while ladies in satin and ermine
cautiously descended the carriage steps which were let down for them
with a clatter and then walked hurriedly and noiselessly over the baize
at the entrance 

almost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran through the
crowd and caps were doffed 

 the emperor no a minister prince ambassador don t you
see the plumes was whispered among the crowd 

one person better dressed than the rest seemed to know everyone and
mentioned by name the greatest dignitaries of the day 

a third of the visitors had already arrived but the rost vs who were
to be present were still hurrying to get dressed 

there had been many discussions and preparations for this ball in the
rost v family many fears that the invitation would not arrive that
the dresses would not be ready or that something would not be arranged
as it should be 

m rya ign tevna per nskaya a thin and shallow maid of honor at
the court of the dowager empress who was a friend and relation of the
countess and piloted the provincial rost vs in petersburg high society 
was to accompany them to the ball 

they were to call for her at her house in the taurida gardens at ten
o clock but it was already five minutes to ten and the girls were
not yet dressed 

nat sha was going to her first grand ball she had got up at eight that
morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all day all
her powers since morning had been concentrated on ensuring that they
all she herself mamma and s nya should be as well dressed as
possible s nya and her mother put themselves entirely in her hands 
the countess was to wear a claret colored velvet dress and the two
girls white gauze over pink silk slips with roses on their bodices and
their hair dressed la grecque 

everything essential had already been done feet hands necks and
ears washed perfumed and powdered as befits a ball the openwork
silk stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on the
hairdressing was almost done s nya was finishing dressing and so was
the countess but nat sha who had bustled about helping them all was
behindhand she was still sitting before a looking glass with a dressing
jacket thrown over her slender shoulders s nya stood ready dressed in
the middle of the room and pressing the head of a pin till it hurt her
dainty finger was fixing on a last ribbon that squeaked as the pin went
through it 

 that s not the way that s not the way s nya cried nat sha
turning her head and clutching with both hands at her hair which the
maid who was dressing it had not time to release that bow is not
right come here 

s nya sat down and nat sha pinned the ribbon on differently 

 allow me miss i can t do it like that said the maid who was
holding nat sha s hair 

 oh dear well then wait that s right s nya 

 aren t you ready it is nearly ten came the countess voice 

 directly directly and you mamma 

 i have only my cap to pin on 

 don t do it without me called nat sha you won t do it
right 

 but it s already ten 

they had decided to be at the ball by half past ten and nat sha had
still to get dressed and they had to call at the taurida gardens 

when her hair was done nat sha in her short petticoat from under
which her dancing shoes showed and in her mother s dressing jacket 
ran up to s nya scrutinized her and then ran to her mother turning
her mother s head this way and that she fastened on the cap and 
hurriedly kissing her gray hair ran back to the maids who were turning
up the hem of her skirt 

the cause of the delay was nat sha s skirt which was too long 
two maids were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of
thread a third with pins in her mouth was running about between the
countess and s nya and a fourth held the whole of the gossamer garment
up high on one uplifted hand 

 m vra quicker darling 

 give me my thimble miss from there 

 whenever will you be ready asked the count coming to the door 
 here is some scent per nskaya must be tired of waiting 

 it s ready miss said the maid holding up the shortened gauze
dress with two fingers and blowing and shaking something off it as if
by this to express a consciousness of the airiness and purity of what
she held 

nat sha began putting on the dress 

 in a minute in a minute don t come in papa she cried to her
father as he opened the door speaking from under the filmy skirt which
still covered her whole face 

s nya slammed the door to a minute later they let the count in he was
wearing a blue swallow tail coat shoes and stockings and was perfumed
and his hair pomaded 

 oh papa how nice you look charming cried nat sha as she
stood in the middle of the room smoothing out the folds of the gauze 

 if you please miss allow me said the maid who on her knees was
pulling the skirt straight and shifting the pins from one side of her
mouth to the other with her tongue 

 say what you like exclaimed s nya in a despairing voice as she
looked at nat sha say what you like it s still too long 

nat sha stepped back to look at herself in the pier glass the dress
was too long 

 really madam it is not at all too long said m vra crawling on
her knees after her young lady 

 well if it s too long we ll tack it up we ll tack it up
in one minute said the resolute duny sha taking a needle that was
stuck on the front of her little shawl and still kneeling on the floor 
set to work once more 

at that moment with soft steps the countess came in shyly in her cap
and velvet gown 

 oo oo my beauty exclaimed the count she looks better than
any of you 

he would have embraced her but blushing she stepped aside fearing to
be rumpled 

 mamma your cap more to this side said nat sha i ll
arrange it and she rushed forward so that the maids who were tacking
up her skirt could not move fast enough and a piece of gauze was torn
off 

 oh goodness what has happened really it was not my fault 

 never mind i ll run it up it won t show said duny sha 

 what a beauty a very queen said the nurse as she came to the
door and s nya they are lovely 

at a quarter past ten they at last got into their carriages and started 
but they had still to call at the taurida gardens 

per nskaya was quite ready in spite of her age and plainness she
had gone through the same process as the rost vs but with less
flurry for to her it was a matter of routine her ugly old body was
washed perfumed and powdered in just the same way she had washed
behind her ears just as carefully and when she entered her drawing
room in her yellow dress wearing her badge as maid of honor her old
lady s maid was as full of rapturous admiration as the rost vs 
servants had been 

she praised the rost vs toilets they praised her taste and toilet 
and at eleven o clock careful of their coiffures and dresses they
settled themselves in their carriages and drove off 





chapter xv

nat sha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not once
had time to think of what lay before her 

in the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage she
for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her there at
the ball in those brightly lighted rooms with music flowers dances 
the emperor and all the brilliant young people of petersburg the
prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it would come true 
so out of keeping was it with the chill darkness and closeness of the
carriage she understood all that awaited her only when after stepping
over the red baize at the entrance she entered the hall took off her
fur cloak and beside s nya and in front of her mother mounted the
brightly illuminated stairs between the flowers only then did she
remember how she must behave at a ball and tried to assume the majestic
air she considered indispensable for a girl on such an occasion but 
fortunately for her she felt her eyes growing misty she saw nothing
clearly her pulse beat a hundred to the minute and the blood throbbed
at her heart she could not assume that pose which would have made her
ridiculous and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying
with all her might to conceal it and this was the very attitude that
became her best before and behind them other visitors were entering 
also talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses the mirrors on the
landing reflected ladies in white pale blue and pink dresses with
diamonds and pearls on their bare necks and arms 

nat sha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her reflection
from the others all was blended into one brilliant procession 
on entering the ballroom the regular hum of voices footsteps and
greetings deafened nat sha and the light and glitter dazzled her still
more the host and hostess who had already been standing at the door
for half an hour repeating the same words to the various arrivals 
 charm de vous voir greeted the rost vs and per nskaya in
the same manner 

 delighted to see you 


the two girls in their white dresses each with a rose in her
black hair both curtsied in the same way but the hostess eye
involuntarily rested longer on the slim nat sha she looked at her
and gave her alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile as
hostess looking at her she may have recalled the golden irrecoverable
days of her own girlhood and her own first ball the host also followed
nat sha with his eyes and asked the count which was his daughter 

 charming said he kissing the tips of his fingers 

in the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting
the emperor the countess took up a position in one of the front rows
of that crowd nat sha heard and felt that several people were asking
about her and looking at her she realized that those noticing her liked
her and this observation helped to calm her 

 there are some like ourselves and some worse she thought 

per nskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important people
at the ball 

 that is the dutch ambassador do you see that gray haired man 
she said indicating an old man with a profusion of silver gray curly
hair who was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he said 

 ah here she is the queen of petersburg countess bez khova 
said per nskaya indicating h l ne who had just entered how
lovely she is quite equal to m rya ant novna see how the men young
and old pay court to her beautiful and clever they say prince
 is quite mad about her but see those two though not
good looking are even more run after 

she pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very plain
daughter 

 she is a splendid match a millionairess said per nskaya and
look here come her suitors 

 that is bez khova s brother anatole kur gin she said 
indicating a handsome officer of the horse guards who passed by them
with head erect looking at something over the heads of the ladies 
 he s handsome isn t he i hear they will marry him to that rich
girl but your cousin drubetsk y is also very attentive to her they
say she has millions oh yes that s the french ambassador himself 
she replied to the countess inquiry about caulaincourt looks as
if he were a king all the same the french are charming very charming 
no one more charming in society ah here she is yes she is still the
most beautiful of them all our m rya ant novna and how simply she
is dressed lovely and that stout one in spectacles is the universal
freemason she went on indicating pierre put him beside his wife
and he looks a regular buffoon 

pierre swaying his stout body advanced making way through the crowd
and nodding to right and left as casually and good naturedly as if he
were passing through a crowd at a fair he pushed through evidently
looking for someone 

nat sha looked joyfully at the familiar face of pierre the
buffoon as per nskaya had called him and knew he was looking for
them and for her in particular he had promised to be at the ball and
introduce partners to her 

but before he reached them pierre stopped beside a very handsome dark
man of middle height and in a white uniform who stood by a window
talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon nat sha at once
recognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform it was
bolk nski who seemed to her to have grown much younger happier and
better looking 

 there s someone else we know bolk nski do you see mamma 
said nat sha pointing out prince andrew you remember he stayed a
night with us at otr dnoe 

 oh you know him said per nskaya i can t bear him il fait
 pr sent la pluie et le beau temps he s too proud for anything 
takes after his father and he s hand in glove with sper nski 
writing some project or other just look how he treats the ladies 
there s one talking to him and he has turned away she said 
pointing at him i d give it to him if he treated me as he does
those ladies 

 he is all the rage just now 






chapter xvi

suddenly everybody stirred began talking and pressed forward and then
back and between the two rows which separated the emperor entered to
the sounds of music that had immediately struck up behind him walked
his host and hostess he walked in rapidly bowing to right and left
as if anxious to get the first moments of the reception over the band
played the polonaise in vogue at that time on account of the words that
had been set to it beginning alexander elisaveta all our hearts
you ravish quite the emperor passed on to the drawing room the
crowd made a rush for the doors and several persons with excited faces
hurried there and back again then the crowd hastily retired from
the drawing room door at which the emperor reappeared talking to the
hostess a young man looking distraught pounced down on the ladies 
asking them to move aside some ladies with faces betraying complete
forgetfulness of all the rules of decorum pushed forward to the
detriment of their toilets the men began to choose partners and take
their places for the polonaise 

everyone moved back and the emperor came smiling out of the drawing
room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the
music the host followed with m rya ant novna nar shkina then
came ambassadors ministers and various generals whom per nskaya
diligently named more than half the ladies already had partners
and were taking up or preparing to take up their positions for the
polonaise nat sha felt that she would be left with her mother and
s nya among a minority of women who crowded near the wall not having
been invited to dance she stood with her slender arms hanging down 
her scarcely defined bosom rising and falling regularly and with
bated breath and glittering frightened eyes gazed straight before
her evidently prepared for the height of joy or misery she was
not concerned about the emperor or any of those great people whom
per nskaya was pointing out she had but one thought is it
possible no one will ask me that i shall not be among the first to
dance is it possible that not one of all these men will notice me 
they do not even seem to see me or if they do they look as if they
were saying ah she s not the one i m after so it s not worth
looking at her no it s impossible she thought they must
know how i long to dance how splendidly i dance and how they would
enjoy dancing with me 

the strains of the polonaise which had continued for a considerable
time had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to nat sha s ears 
she wanted to cry per nskaya had left them the count was at the
other end of the room she and the countess and s nya were standing by
themselves as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of strangers 
with no one interested in them and not wanted by anyone prince andrew
with a lady passed by evidently not recognizing them the handsome
anatole was smilingly talking to a partner on his arm and looked at
nat sha as one looks at a wall bor s passed them twice and each time
turned away berg and his wife who were not dancing came up to them 

this family gathering seemed humiliating to nat sha as if there were
nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball she did not
listen to or look at v ra who was telling her something about her own
green dress 

at last the emperor stopped beside his last partner he had danced
with three and the music ceased a worried aide de camp ran up to the
rost vs requesting them to stand farther back though as it was they
were already close to the wall and from the gallery resounded the
distinct precise enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz the emperor
looked smilingly down the room a minute passed but no one had yet begun
dancing an aide de camp the master of ceremonies went up to countess
bez khova and asked her to dance she smilingly raised her hand and
laid it on his shoulder without looking at him the aide de camp an
adept in his art grasping his partner firmly round her waist with
confident deliberation started smoothly gliding first round the edge of
the circle then at the corner of the room he caught h l ne s
left hand and turned her the only sound audible apart from the
ever quickening music being the rhythmic click of the spurs on his
rapid agile feet while at every third beat his partner s velvet
dress spread out and seemed to flash as she whirled round nat sha
gazed at them and was ready to cry because it was not she who was
dancing that first turn of the waltz 

prince andrew in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel wearing
stockings and dancing shoes stood looking animated and bright in the
front row of the circle not far from the rost vs baron firhoff was
talking to him about the first sitting of the council of state to be
held next day prince andrew as one closely connected with sper nski
and participating in the work of the legislative commission could give
reliable information about that sitting concerning which various rumors
were current but not listening to what firhoff was saying he was
gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance who
had not yet gathered courage to enter the circle 

prince andrew was watching these men abashed by the emperor s
presence and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to
dance 

pierre came up to him and caught him by the arm 

 you always dance i have a prot g e the young rost va here ask
her he said 

 where is she asked bolk nski excuse me he added turning
to the baron we will finish this conversation elsewhere at a ball
one must dance he stepped forward in the direction pierre indicated 
the despairing dejected expression of nat sha s face caught his eye 
he recognized her guessed her feelings saw that it was her d but 
remembered her conversation at the window and with an expression of
pleasure on his face approached countess rost va 

 allow me to introduce you to my daughter said the countess with
heightened color 

 i have the pleasure of being already acquainted if the countess
remembers me said prince andrew with a low and courteous bow quite
belying per nskaya s remarks about his rudeness and approaching
nat sha he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed
his invitation he asked her to waltz that tremulous expression on
nat sha s face prepared either for despair or rapture suddenly
brightened into a happy grateful childlike smile 

 i have long been waiting for you that frightened happy little
girl seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears as
she raised her hand to prince andrew s shoulder they were the second
couple to enter the circle prince andrew was one of the best dancers of
his day and nat sha danced exquisitely her little feet in their white
satin dancing shoes did their work swiftly lightly and independently
of herself while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness her slender
bare arms and neck were not beautiful compared to h l ne s her
shoulders looked thin and her bosom undeveloped but h l ne seemed as
it were hardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had
scanned her person while nat sha was like a girl exposed for the first
time who would have felt very much ashamed had she not been assured
that this was absolutely necessary 

prince andrew liked dancing and wishing to escape as quickly as
possible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed
to him wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he disliked 
caused by the emperor s presence he danced and had chosen nat sha
because pierre pointed her out to him and because she was the first
pretty girl who caught his eye but scarcely had he embraced that
slender supple figure and felt her stirring so close to him and smiling
so near him than the wine of her charm rose to his head and he
felt himself revived and rejuvenated when after leaving her he stood
breathing deeply and watching the other dancers 





chapter xvii

after prince andrew bor s came up to ask nat sha for a dance and
then the aide de camp who had opened the ball and several other young
men so that flushed and happy and passing on her superfluous partners
to s nya she did not cease dancing all the evening she noticed and
saw nothing of what occupied everyone else not only did she fail to
notice that the emperor talked a long time with the french ambassador 
and how particularly gracious he was to a certain lady or that prince
so and so and so and so did and said this and that and that h l ne
had great success and was honored by the special attention of so and so 
but she did not even see the emperor and only noticed that he had gone
because the ball became livelier after his departure for one of the
merry cotillions before supper prince andrew was again her partner he
reminded her of their first encounter in the otr dnoe avenue and how
she had been unable to sleep that moonlight night and told her how he
had involuntarily overheard her nat sha blushed at that recollection
and tried to excuse herself as if there had been something to be
ashamed of in what prince andrew had overheard 

like all men who have grown up in society prince andrew liked meeting
someone there not of the conventional society stamp and such was
nat sha with her surprise her delight her shyness and even her
mistakes in speaking french with her he behaved with special care and
tenderness sitting beside her and talking of the simplest and most
unimportant matters he admired her shy grace in the middle of the
cotillion having completed one of the figures nat sha still out of
breath was returning to her seat when another dancer chose her she was
tired and panting and evidently thought of declining but immediately
put her hand gaily on the man s shoulder smiling at prince andrew 

 i d be glad to sit beside you and rest i m tired but you see
how they keep asking me and i m glad of it i m happy and i love
everybody and you and i understand it all and much much more was
said in her smile when her partner left her nat sha ran across the
room to choose two ladies for the figure 

 if she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady she will be
my wife said prince andrew to himself quite to his own surprise as
he watched her she did go first to her cousin 

 what rubbish sometimes enters one s head thought prince andrew 
 but what is certain is that that girl is so charming so original 
that she won t be dancing here a month before she will be married 
such as she are rare here he thought as nat sha readjusting a
rose that was slipping on her bodice settled herself beside him 

when the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up to
the dancers he invited prince andrew to come and see them and asked
his daughter whether she was enjoying herself nat sha did not answer
at once but only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully how
can you ask such a question 

 i have never enjoyed myself so much before she said and prince
andrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her
father and instantly dropped again nat sha was happier than she had
ever been in her life she was at that height of bliss when one becomes
completely kind and good and does not believe in the possibility of
evil unhappiness or sorrow 

at that ball pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position
his wife occupied in court circles he was gloomy and absent minded a
deep furrow ran across his forehead and standing by a window he stared
over his spectacles seeing no one 

on her way to supper nat sha passed him 

pierre s gloomy unhappy look struck her she stopped in front of him 
she wished to help him to bestow on him the superabundance of her own
happiness 

 how delightful it is count said she isn t it 

pierre smiled absent mindedly evidently not grasping what she said 

 yes i am very glad he said 

 how can people be dissatisfied with anything thought nat sha 
 especially such a capital fellow as bez khov in nat sha s
eyes all the people at the ball alike were good kind and splendid
people loving one another none of them capable of injuring
another and so they ought all to be happy 





chapter xviii

next day prince andrew thought of the ball but his mind did not dwell
on it long yes it was a very brilliant ball and then yes 
that little rost va is very charming there s something fresh 
original un petersburg like about her that distinguishes her that
was all he thought about yesterday s ball and after his morning tea
he set to work 

but either from fatigue or want of sleep he was ill disposed for work
and could get nothing done he kept criticizing his own work as he
often did and was glad when he heard someone coming 

the visitor was b tski who served on various committees frequented
all the societies in petersburg and a passionate devotee of the new
ideas and of sper nski and a diligent petersburg newsmonger one of
those men who choose their opinions like their clothes according to
the fashion but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest
partisans hardly had he got rid of his hat before he ran into prince
andrew s room with a preoccupied air and at once began talking he
had just heard particulars of that morning s sitting of the council
of state opened by the emperor and he spoke of it enthusiastically the
emperor s speech had been extraordinary it had been a speech such as
only constitutional monarchs deliver the sovereign plainly said
that the council and senate are estates of the realm he said that the
government must rest not on authority but on secure bases the emperor
said that the fiscal system must be reorganized and the accounts
published recounted b tski emphasizing certain words and opening
his eyes significantly 

 ah yes today s events mark an epoch the greatest epoch in our
history he concluded 

prince andrew listened to the account of the opening of the council of
state which he had so impatiently awaited and to which he had attached
such importance and was surprised that this event now that it had
taken place did not affect him and even seemed quite insignificant he
listened with quiet irony to b tski s enthusiastic account of it a
very simple thought occurred to him what does it matter to me or to
b tski what the emperor was pleased to say at the council can all that
make me any happier or better 

and this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest prince
andrew had felt in the impending reforms he was going to dine that
evening at sper nski s with only a few friends as the host
had said when inviting him the prospect of that dinner in the intimate
home circle of the man he so admired had greatly interested prince
andrew especially as he had not yet seen sper nski in his domestic
surroundings but now he felt disinclined to go to it 

at the appointed hour however he entered the modest house sper nski
owned in the taurida gardens in the parqueted dining room this small
house remarkable for its extreme cleanliness suggesting that of a
monastery prince andrew who was rather late found the friendly
gathering of sper nski s intimate acquaintances already assembled
at five o clock there were no ladies present except sper nski s
little daughter long faced like her father and her governess the
other guests were gervais magn tski and stol pin while still in
the anteroom prince andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato
laugh a laugh such as one hears on the stage someone it sounded
like sper nski was distinctly ejaculating ha ha ha prince andrew
had never before heard sper nski s famous laugh and this ringing 
high pitched laughter from a statesman made a strange impression on him 

he entered the dining room the whole company were standing between two
windows at a small table laid with hors d oeuvres sper nski wearing
a gray swallow tail coat with a star on the breast and evidently still
the same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of
the council of state stood at the table with a beaming countenance his
guests surrounded him magn tski addressing himself to sper nski 
was relating an anecdote and sper nski was laughing in advance at
what magn tski was going to say when prince andrew entered the room
magn tski s words were again crowned by laughter stol pin gave
a deep bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese gervais
laughed softly with a hissing chuckle and sper nski in a high pitched
staccato manner 

still laughing sper nski held out his soft white hand to prince
andrew 

 very pleased to see you prince he said one moment he
went on turning to magn tski and interrupting his story we have
agreed that this is a dinner for recreation with not a word about
business and turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh 

prince andrew looked at the laughing sper nski with astonishment 
regret and disillusionment it seemed to him that this was not
sper nski but someone else everything that had formerly appeared
mysterious and fascinating in sper nski suddenly became plain and
unattractive 

at dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed to
consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes before magn tski
had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate something
still funnier most of the anecdotes if not relating to the state
service related to people in the service it seemed that in this
company the insignificance of those people was so definitely accepted
that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humored
ridicule sper nski related how at the council that morning a deaf
dignitary when asked his opinion replied that he thought so too 
gervais gave a long account of an official revision remarkable for the
stupidity of everybody concerned stol pin stuttering broke into
the conversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existed
under the former order of things threatening to give a serious turn
to the conversation magn tski starting quizzing stol pin about his
vehemence gervais intervened with a joke and the talk reverted to its
former lively tone 

evidently sper nski liked to rest after his labors and find amusement
in a circle of friends and his guests understanding his wish tried
to enliven him and amuse themselves but their gaiety seemed to prince
andrew mirthless and tiresome sper nski s high pitched voice struck
him unpleasantly and the incessant laughter grated on him like a false
note prince andrew did not laugh and feared that he would be a damper
on the spirits of the company but no one took any notice of his being
out of harmony with the general mood they all seemed very gay 

he tried several times to join in the conversation but his remarks were
tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water and he could
not jest with them 

there was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said it was witty and
might have been funny but it lacked just that something which is the
salt of mirth and they were not even aware that such a thing existed 

after dinner sper nski s daughter and her governess rose he patted
the little girl with his white hand and kissed her and that gesture 
too seemed unnatural to prince andrew 

the men remained at table over their port english fashion in the
midst of a conversation that was started about napoleon s spanish
affairs which they all agreed in approving prince andrew began to
express a contrary opinion sper nski smiled and with an evident wish
to prevent the conversation from taking an unpleasant course told a
story that had no connection with the previous conversation for a few
moments all were silent 

having sat some time at table sper nski corked a bottle of wine and 
remarking nowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair passed
it to the servant and got up all rose and continuing to talk loudly
went into the drawing room two letters brought by a courier were handed
to sper nski and he took them to his study as soon as he had left
the room the general merriment stopped and the guests began to converse
sensibly and quietly with one another 

 now for the recitation said sper nski on returning from
his study a wonderful talent he said to prince andrew and
magn tski immediately assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous
verses in french which he had composed about various well known
petersburg people he was interrupted several times by applause when
the verses were finished prince andrew went up to sper nski and took
his leave 

 where are you off to so early asked sper nski 

 i promised to go to a reception 

they said no more prince andrew looked closely into those mirrorlike 
impenetrable eyes and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to have
expected anything from sper nski and from any of his own activities
connected with him or ever to have attributed importance to what
sper nski was doing that precise mirthless laughter rang in prince
andrew s ears long after he had left the house 

when he reached home prince andrew began thinking of his life in
petersburg during those last four months as if it were something new he
recalled his exertions and solicitations and the history of his project
of army reform which had been accepted for consideration and which they
were trying to pass over in silence simply because another a very poor
one had already been prepared and submitted to the emperor he thought
of the meetings of a committee of which berg was a member he remembered
how carefully and at what length everything relating to form and
procedure was discussed at those meetings and how sedulously and
promptly all that related to the gist of the business was evaded he
recalled his labors on the legal code and how painstakingly he had
translated the articles of the roman and french codes into russian 
and he felt ashamed of himself then he vividly pictured to himself
boguch rovo his occupations in the country his journey to ryaz n 
he remembered the peasants and dron the village elder and mentally
applying to them the personal rights he had divided into paragraphs he
felt astonished that he could have spent so much time on such useless
work 





chapter xix

next day prince andrew called at a few houses he had not visited before 
and among them at the rost vs with whom he had renewed acquaintance
at the ball apart from considerations of politeness which demanded the
call he wanted to see that original eager girl who had left such a
pleasant impression on his mind in her own home 

nat sha was one of the first to meet him she was wearing a dark blue
house dress in which prince andrew thought her even prettier than in
her ball dress she and all the rost v family welcomed him as an old
friend simply and cordially the whole family whom he had formerly
judged severely now seemed to him to consist of excellent simple 
and kindly people the old count s hospitality and good nature which
struck one especially in petersburg as a pleasant surprise were such
that prince andrew could not refuse to stay to dinner yes 
he thought they are capital people who of course have not the
slightest idea what a treasure they possess in nat sha but they are
kindly folk and form the best possible setting for this strikingly
poetic charming girl overflowing with life 

in nat sha prince andrew was conscious of a strange world completely
alien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him a different world 
that in the otr dnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night
had already begun to disconcert him now this world disconcerted him no
longer and was no longer alien to him but he himself having entered it
found in it a new enjoyment 

after dinner nat sha at prince andrew s request went to the
clavichord and began singing prince andrew stood by a window talking
to the ladies and listened to her in the midst of a phrase he ceased
speaking and suddenly felt tears choking him a thing he had thought
impossible for him he looked at nat sha as she sang and something new
and joyful stirred in his soul he felt happy and at the same time sad 
he had absolutely nothing to weep about yet he was ready to weep what
about his former love the little princess his disillusionments 
his hopes for the future yes and no the chief reason was a sudden 
vivid sense of the terrible contrast between something infinitely great
and illimitable within him and that limited and material something that
he and even she was this contrast weighed on and yet cheered him
while she sang 

as soon as nat sha had finished she went up to him and asked how he
liked her voice she asked this and then became confused feeling that
she ought not to have asked it he smiled looking at her and said he
liked her singing as he liked everything she did 

prince andrew left the rost vs late in the evening he went to bed
from habit but soon realized that he could not sleep having lit his
candle he sat up in bed then got up then lay down again not at all
troubled by his sleeplessness his soul was as fresh and joyful as if he
had stepped out of a stuffy room into god s own fresh air it did not
enter his head that he was in love with nat sha he was not thinking
about her but only picturing her to himself and in consequence all
life appeared in a new light why do i strive why do i toil in this
narrow confined frame when life all life with all its joys is open
to me said he to himself and for the first time for a very long
while he began making happy plans for the future he decided that he
must attend to his son s education by finding a tutor and putting
the boy in his charge then he ought to retire from the service and go
abroad and see england switzerland and italy i must use my freedom
while i feel so much strength and youth in me he said to himself 
 pierre was right when he said one must believe in the possibility of
happiness in order to be happy and now i do believe in it let the dead
bury their dead but while one has life one must live and be happy 
thought he 





chapter xx

one morning colonel berg whom pierre knew as he knew everybody in
moscow and petersburg came to see him berg arrived in an immaculate
brand new uniform with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his
temples as the emperor alexander wore his hair 

 i have just been to see the countess your wife unfortunately she
could not grant my request but i hope count i shall be more fortunate
with you he said with a smile 

 what is it you wish colonel i am at your service 

 i have now quite settled in my new rooms count berg said
this with perfect conviction that this information could not but be
agreeable and so i wish to arrange just a small party for my own
and my wife s friends he smiled still more pleasantly i
wished to ask the countess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea
and to supper 

only countess h l ne considering the society of such people as the
bergs beneath her could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitation 
berg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at his house a small
but select company and why this would give him pleasure and why though
he grudged spending money on cards or anything harmful he was prepared
to run into some expense for the sake of good society that pierre
could not refuse and promised to come 

 but don t be late count if i may venture to ask about ten
minutes to eight please we shall make up a rubber our general is
coming he is very good to me we shall have supper count so you will
do me the favor 

contrary to his habit of being late pierre on that day arrived at the
bergs house not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight 

having prepared everything necessary for the party the bergs were ready
for their guests arrival 

in their new clean and light study with its small busts and pictures
and new furniture sat berg and his wife berg closely buttoned up in
his new uniform sat beside his wife explaining to her that one always
could and should be acquainted with people above one because only then
does one get satisfaction from acquaintances 

 you can get to know something you can ask for something see how i
managed from my first promotion berg measured his life not by years
but by promotions my comrades are still nobodies while i am only
waiting for a vacancy to command a regiment and have the happiness to
be your husband he rose and kissed v ra s hand and on the way
to her straightened out a turned up corner of the carpet and
how have i obtained all this chiefly by knowing how to choose my
aquaintances it goes without saying that one must be conscientious and
methodical 

berg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman and
paused reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak
woman who could not understand all that constitutes a man s dignity 
what it was ein mann zu sein v ra at the same time smiling with a
sense of superiority over her good conscientious husband who all the
same understood life wrongly as according to v ra all men did berg 
judging by his wife thought all women weak and foolish v ra judging
only by her husband and generalizing from that observation supposed
that all men though they understand nothing and are conceited and
selfish ascribe common sense to themselves alone 

 to be a man 

berg rose and embraced his wife carefully so as not to crush her lace
fichu for which he had paid a good price kissing her straight on the
lips 

 the only thing is we mustn t have children too soon he
continued following an unconscious sequence of ideas 

 yes answered v ra i don t at all want that we must live
for society 

 princess yus pova wore one exactly like this said berg pointing
to the fichu with a happy and kindly smile 

just then count bez khov was announced husband and wife glanced at one
another both smiling with self satisfaction and each mentally claiming
the honor of this visit 

 this is what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances thought
berg this is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself 

 but please don t interrupt me when i am entertaining the guests 
said v ra because i know what interests each of them and what to
say to different people 

berg smiled again 

 it can t be helped men must sometimes have masculine
conversation said he 

they received pierre in their small new drawing room where it was
impossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry 
neatness and order so it was quite comprehensible and not strange that
berg having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchair
or of the sofa for his dear guest but being apparently painfully
undecided on the matter himself eventually left the visitor to settle
the question of selection pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a
chair for himself and berg and v ra immediately began their evening
party interrupting each other in their efforts to entertain their
guest 

v ra having decided in her own mind that pierre ought to be
entertained with conversation about the french embassy at once began
accordingly berg having decided that masculine conversation was
required interrupted his wife s remarks and touched on the question
of the war with austria and unconsciously jumped from the general
subject to personal considerations as to the proposals made him to take
part in the austrian campaign and the reasons why he had declined them 
though the conversation was very incoherent and v ra was angry at the
intrusion of the masculine element both husband and wife felt with
satisfaction that even if only one guest was present their evening had
begun very well and was as like as two peas to every other evening party
with its talk tea and lighted candles 

before long bor s berg s old comrade arrived there was a shade of
condescension and patronage in his treatment of berg and v ra after
bor s came a lady with the colonel then the general himself then the
rost vs and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other
evening parties berg and v ra could not repress their smiles of
satisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing room 
at the sound of the disconnected talk the rustling of dresses and the
bowing and scraping everything was just as everybody always has it 
especially so the general who admired the apartment patted berg on the
shoulder and with parental authority superintended the setting out of
the table for boston the general sat down by count ily rost v who
was next to himself the most important guest the old people sat with
the old the young with the young and the hostess at the tea table on
which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a silver cake basket as
the panins had at their party everything was just as it was everywhere
else 





chapter xxi

pierre as one of the principal guests had to sit down to boston
with count rost v the general and the colonel at the card table he
happened to be directly facing nat sha and was struck by a curious
change that had come over her since the ball she was silent and not
only less pretty than at the ball but only redeemed from plainness by
her look of gentle indifference to everything around 

 what s the matter with her thought pierre glancing at her 
she was sitting by her sister at the tea table and reluctantly without
looking at him made some reply to bor s who sat down beside her after
playing out a whole suit and to his partner s delight taking five
tricks pierre hearing greetings and the steps of someone who had
entered the room while he was picking up his tricks glanced again at
nat sha 

 what has happened to her he asked himself with still greater
surprise 

prince andrew was standing before her saying something to her with a
look of tender solicitude she having raised her head was looking up
at him flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid breathing and
the bright glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was again
alight in her she was completely transformed and from a plain girl had
again become what she had been at the ball 

prince andrew went up to pierre and the latter noticed a new and
youthful expression in his friend s face 

pierre changed places several times during the game sitting now with
his back to nat sha and now facing her but during the whole of the six
rubbers he watched her and his friend 

 something very important is happening between them thought
pierre and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and
made him neglect the game 

after six rubbers the general got up saying that it was no use playing
like that and pierre was released nat sha on one side was talking
with s nya and bor s and v ra with a subtle smile was saying
something to prince andrew pierre went up to his friend and asking
whether they were talking secrets sat down beside them v ra having
noticed prince andrew s attentions to nat sha decided that at a
party a real evening party subtle allusions to the tender passion were
absolutely necessary and seizing a moment when prince andrew was alone 
began a conversation with him about feelings in general and about her
sister with so intellectual a guest as she considered prince andrew to
be she felt that she had to employ her diplomatic tact 

when pierre went up to them he noticed that v ra was being carried away
by her self satisfied talk but that prince andrew seemed embarrassed a
thing that rarely happened with him 

 what do you think v ra was saying with an arch smile you are
so discerning prince and understand people s characters so well at
a glance what do you think of natalie could she be constant in her
attachments could she like other women v ra meant herself 
 love a man once for all and remain true to him forever that is what
i consider true love what do you think prince 

 i know your sister too little replied prince andrew with a
sarcastic smile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment to
be able to solve so delicate a question and then i have noticed that
the less attractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to be 
he added and looked up at pierre who was just approaching them 

 yes that is true prince in our days continued
v ra mentioning our days as people of limited intelligence are
fond of doing imagining that they have discovered and appraised the
peculiarities of our days and that human characteristics change
with the times in our days a girl has so much freedom that the
pleasure of being courted often stifles real feeling in her and it must
be confessed that natalie is very susceptible this return to
the subject of natalie caused prince andrew to knit his brows with
discomfort he was about to rise but v ra continued with a still more
subtle smile 

 i think no one has been more courted than she she went on but
till quite lately she never cared seriously for anyone now you know 
count she said to pierre even our dear cousin bor s who 
between ourselves was very far gone in the land of tenderness 
 alluding to a map of love much in vogue at that time 

prince andrew frowned and remained silent 

 you are friendly with bor s aren t you asked v ra 

 yes i know him 

 i expect he has told you of his childish love for nat sha 

 oh there was childish love suddenly asked prince andrew 
blushing unexpectedly 

 yes you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love le
cousinage est un dangereux voisinage don t you think so 

 cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood 


 oh undoubtedly said prince andrew and with sudden and unnatural
liveliness he began chaffing pierre about the need to be very careful
with his fifty year old moscow cousins and in the midst of these
jesting remarks he rose taking pierre by the arm and drew him aside 

 well asked pierre seeing his friend s strange animation with
surprise and noticing the glance he turned on nat sha as he rose 

 i must i must have a talk with you said prince andrew you
know that pair of women s gloves he referred to the masonic
gloves given to a newly initiated brother to present to the woman he
loved i but no i will talk to you later on and with a
strange light in his eyes and restlessness in his movements prince
andrew approached nat sha and sat down beside her pierre saw how
prince andrew asked her something and how she flushed as she replied 

but at that moment berg came to pierre and began insisting that he
should take part in an argument between the general and the colonel on
the affairs in spain 

berg was satisfied and happy the smile of pleasure never left his face 
the party was very successful and quite like other parties he had
seen everything was similar the ladies subtle talk the cards the
general raising his voice at the card table and the samovar and the tea
cakes only one thing was lacking that he had always seen at the evening
parties he wished to imitate they had not yet had a loud conversation
among the men and a dispute about something important and clever now
the general had begun such a discussion and so berg drew pierre to it 





chapter xxii

next day having been invited by the count prince andrew dined with the
rost vs and spent the rest of the day there 

everyone in the house realized for whose sake prince andrew came and
without concealing it he tried to be with nat sha all day not only in
the soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured nat sha but in the
whole house there was a feeling of awe at something important that was
bound to happen the countess looked with sad and sternly serious eyes
at prince andrew when he talked to nat sha and timidly started some
artificial conversation about trifles as soon as he looked her way 
s nya was afraid to leave nat sha and afraid of being in the way when
she was with them nat sha grew pale in a panic of expectation when
she remained alone with him for a moment prince andrew surprised her by
his timidity she felt that he wanted to say something to her but could
not bring himself to do so 

in the evening when prince andrew had left the countess went up to
nat sha and whispered well what 

 mamma for heaven s sake don t ask me anything now one can t
talk about that said nat sha 

but all the same that night nat sha now agitated and now frightened 
lay a long time in her mother s bed gazing straight before her she
told her how he had complimented her how he told her he was going
abroad asked her where they were going to spend the summer and then
how he had asked her about bor s 

 but such a such a never happened to me before she said 
 only i feel afraid in his presence i am always afraid when i m
with him what does that mean does it mean that it s the real thing 
yes mamma are you asleep 

 no my love i am frightened myself answered her mother now
go 

 all the same i shan t sleep what silliness to sleep mummy 
mummy such a thing never happened to me before she said surprised
and alarmed at the feeling she was aware of in herself and could we
ever have thought 

it seemed to nat sha that even at the time she first saw prince andrew
at otr dnoe she had fallen in love with him it was as if she feared
this strange unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she had
then chosen she was firmly convinced she had done so and of finding
him as it seemed not indifferent to her 

 and it had to happen that he should come specially to petersburg
while we are here and it had to happen that we should meet at that
ball it is fate clearly it is fate that everything led up to this 
already then directly i saw him i felt something peculiar 

 what else did he say to you what are those verses read them 
said her mother thoughtfully referring to some verses prince andrew
had written in nat sha s album 

 mamma one need not be ashamed of his being a widower 

 don t nat sha pray to god marriages are made in
heaven said her mother 

 darling mummy how i love you how happy i am cried nat sha 
shedding tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother 

at that very time prince andrew was sitting with pierre and telling him
of his love for nat sha and his firm resolve to make her his wife 

that day countess h l ne had a reception at her house the french
ambassador was there and a foreign prince of the blood who had of
late become a frequent visitor of hers and many brilliant ladies and
gentlemen pierre who had come downstairs walked through the rooms and
struck everyone by his preoccupied absent minded and morose air 

since the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depression
and had made desperate efforts to combat it since the intimacy of
his wife with the royal prince pierre had unexpectedly been made a
gentleman of the bedchamber and from that time he had begun to feel
oppressed and ashamed in court society and dark thoughts of the vanity
of all things human came to him oftener than before at the same time
the feeling he had noticed between his prot g e nat sha and prince
andrew accentuated his gloom by the contrast between his own position
and his friend s he tried equally to avoid thinking about his wife 
and about nat sha and prince andrew and again everything seemed to him
insignificant in comparison with eternity again the question for what 
presented itself and he forced himself to work day and night at masonic
labors hoping to drive away the evil spirit that threatened him toward
midnight after he had left the countess apartments he was sitting
upstairs in a shabby dressing gown copying out the original transaction
of the scottish lodge of freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy
with tobacco smoke when someone came in it was prince andrew 

 ah it s you said pierre with a preoccupied dissatisfied air 
 and i you see am hard at it he pointed to his manuscript book
with that air of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy
people look at their work 

prince andrew with a beaming ecstatic expression of renewed life on
his face paused in front of pierre and not noticing his sad look 
smiled at him with the egotism of joy 

 well dear heart said he i wanted to tell you about it
yesterday and i have come to do so today i never experienced anything
like it before i am in love my friend 

suddenly pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person down on
the sofa beside prince andrew 

 with nat sha rost va yes said he 

 yes yes who else should it be i should never have believed it 
but the feeling is stronger than i yesterday i tormented myself and
suffered but i would not exchange even that torment for anything in
the world i have not lived till now at last i live but i can t
live without her but can she love me i am too old for her why
don t you speak 

 i i what did i tell you said pierre suddenly rising and
beginning to pace up and down the room i always thought it that
girl is such a treasure she is a rare girl my dear friend 
i entreat you don t philosophize don t doubt marry marry 
marry and i am sure there will not be a happier man than you 

 but what of her 

 she loves you 

 don t talk rubbish said prince andrew smiling and looking
into pierre s eyes 

 she does i know pierre cried fiercely 

 but do listen returned prince andrew holding him by the
arm do you know the condition i am in i must talk about it to
someone 

 well go on go on i am very glad said pierre and his face
really changed his brow became smooth and he listened gladly to prince
andrew prince andrew seemed and really was quite a different quite
a new man where was his spleen his contempt for life his
disillusionment pierre was the only person to whom he made up his mind
to speak openly and to him he told all that was in his soul now he
boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future said he could not
sacrifice his own happiness to his father s caprice and spoke of how
he would either make his father consent to this marriage and love her 
or would do without his consent then he marveled at the feeling that
had mastered him as at something strange apart from and independent of
himself 

 i should not have believed anyone who told me that i was capable of
such love said prince andrew it is not at all the same feeling
that i knew in the past the whole world is now for me divided into two
halves one half is she and there all is joy hope light the
other half is everything where she is not and there is all gloom and
darkness 

 darkness and gloom reiterated pierre yes yes i understand
that 

 i cannot help loving the light it is not my fault and i am very
happy you understand me i know you are glad for my sake 

 yes yes pierre assented looking at his friend with a touched
and sad expression in his eyes the brighter prince andrew s lot
appeared to him the gloomier seemed his own 





chapter xxiii

prince andrew needed his father s consent to his marriage and to
obtain this he started for the country next day 

his father received his son s communication with external composure 
but inward wrath he could not comprehend how anyone could wish to
alter his life or introduce anything new into it when his own life
was already ending if only they would let me end my days as i want
to thought the old man then they might do as they please 
with his son however he employed the diplomacy he reserved for
important occasions and adopting a quiet tone discussed the whole
matter 

in the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards
birth wealth or rank secondly prince andrew was no longer as young
as he had been and his health was poor the old man laid special stress
on this while she was very young thirdly he had a son whom it would
be a pity to entrust to a chit of a girl fourthly and finally 
the father said looking ironically at his son i beg you to put it
off for a year go abroad take a cure look out as you wanted to for
a german tutor for prince nicholas then if your love or passion or
obstinacy as you please is still as great marry and that s my
last word on it mind the last concluded the prince in a tone
which showed that nothing would make him alter his decision 

prince andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his feelings or
his fianc e s would not stand a year s test or that he the old
prince himself would die before then and he decided to conform to his
father s wish to propose and postpone the wedding for a year 

three weeks after the last evening he had spent with the rost vs 
prince andrew returned to petersburg 


next day after her talk with her mother nat sha expected bolk nski all
day but he did not come on the second and third day it was the same 
pierre did not come either and nat sha not knowing that prince andrew
had gone to see his father could not explain his absence to herself 

three weeks passed in this way nat sha had no desire to go out
anywhere and wandered from room to room like a shadow idle and
listless she wept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in the
evenings she blushed continually and was irritable it seemed to her
that everybody knew about her disappointment and was laughing at her and
pitying her strong as was her inward grief this wound to her vanity
intensified her misery 

once she came to her mother tried to say something and suddenly began
to cry her tears were those of an offended child who does not know why
it is being punished 

the countess began to soothe nat sha who after first listening to her
mother s words suddenly interrupted her 

 leave off mamma i don t think and don t want to think about
it he just came and then left off left off 

her voice trembled and she again nearly cried but recovered and went
on quietly 

 and i don t at all want to get married and i am afraid of him i
have now become quite calm quite calm 

the day after this conversation nat sha put on the old dress which
she knew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the
mornings and that day she returned to the old way of life which she had
abandoned since the ball having finished her morning tea she went to
the ballroom which she particularly liked for its loud resonance and
began singing her solfeggio when she had finished her first exercise
she stood still in the middle of the room and sang a musical phrase that
particularly pleased her she listened joyfully as though she had not
expected it to the charm of the notes reverberating filling the
whole empty ballroom and slowly dying away and all at once she felt
cheerful what s the good of making so much of it things are nice
as it is she said to herself and she began walking up and down the
room not stepping simply on the resounding parquet but treading with
each step from the heel to the toe she had on a new and favorite pair
of shoes and listening to the regular tap of the heel and creak of
the toe as gladly as she had to the sounds of her own voice passing a
mirror she glanced into it there that s me the expression of
her face seemed to say as she caught sight of herself well and very
nice too i need nobody 

a footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room but she
would not let him and having closed the door behind him continued her
walk that morning she had returned to her favorite mood love of 
and delight in herself how charming that nat sha is she said
again speaking as some third collective male person pretty 
a good voice young and in nobody s way if only they leave her in
peace but however much they left her in peace she could not now be
at peace and immediately felt this 

in the hall the porch door opened and someone asked at home and
then footsteps were heard nat sha was looking at the mirror but did
not see herself she listened to the sounds in the hall when she saw
herself her face was pale it was he she knew this for certain though
she hardly heard his voice through the closed doors 

pale and agitated nat sha ran into the drawing room 

 mamma bolk nski has come she said mamma it is awful it is
unbearable i don t want to be tormented what am i to do 

before the countess could answer prince andrew entered the room with
an agitated and serious face as soon as he saw nat sha his face
brightened he kissed the countess hand and nat sha s and sat
down beside the sofa 

 it is long since we had the pleasure began the countess 
but prince andrew interrupted her by answering her intended question 
obviously in haste to say what he had to 

 i have not been to see you all this time because i have been at my
father s i had to talk over a very important matter with him i only
got back last night he said glancing at nat sha i want to have
a talk with you countess he added after a moment s pause 

the countess lowered her eyes sighing deeply 

 i am at your disposal she murmured 

nat sha knew that she ought to go away but was unable to do so 
something gripped her throat and regardless of manners she stared
straight at prince andrew with wide open eyes 

 at once this instant no it can t be she thought 

again he glanced at her and that glance convinced her that she was not
mistaken yes at once that very instant her fate would be decided 

 go nat sha i will call you said the countess in a whisper 

nat sha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at prince andrew and at
her mother and went out 

 i have come countess to ask for your daughter s hand said
prince andrew 

the countess face flushed hotly but she said nothing 

 your offer she began at last sedately he remained silent 
looking into her eyes your offer she grew confused is
agreeable to us and i accept your offer i am glad and my husband i
hope but it will depend on her 

 i will speak to her when i have your consent do you give it to
me said prince andrew 

 yes replied the countess she held out her hand to him and with
a mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his
forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand she wished to love him as a
son but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man i
am sure my husband will consent said the countess but your
father 

 my father to whom i have told my plans has made it an express
condition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a
year and i wished to tell you of that said prince andrew 

 it is true that nat sha is still young but so long as that 

 it is unavoidable said prince andrew with a sigh 

 i will send her to you said the countess and left the room 

 lord have mercy upon us she repeated while seeking her daughter 

s nya said that nat sha was in her bedroom nat sha was sitting on
the bed pale and dry eyed and was gazing at the icons and whispering
something as she rapidly crossed herself seeing her mother she jumped
up and flew to her 

 well mamma well 

 go go to him he is asking for your hand said the countess 
coldly it seemed to nat sha go go said the mother sadly and
reproachfully with a deep sigh as her daughter ran away 

nat sha never remembered how she entered the drawing room when she
came in and saw him she paused is it possible that this stranger
has now become everything to me she asked herself and immediately
answered yes everything he alone is now dearer to me than
everything in the world prince andrew came up to her with downcast
eyes 

 i have loved you from the very first moment i saw you may i hope 

he looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of
her face her face said why ask why doubt what you cannot but know 
why speak when words cannot express what one feels 

she drew near to him and stopped he took her hand and kissed it 

 do you love me 

 yes yes nat sha murmured as if in vexation then she sighed
loudly and catching her breath more and more quickly began to sob 

 what is it what s the matter 

 oh i am so happy she replied smiled through her tears bent
over closer to him paused for an instant as if asking herself whether
she might and then kissed him 

prince andrew held her hands looked into her eyes and did not find
in his heart his former love for her something in him had suddenly
changed there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of
desire but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness fear
at her devotion and trustfulness and an oppressive yet joyful sense of
the duty that now bound him to her forever the present feeling though
not so bright and poetic as the former was stronger and more serious 

 did your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year asked
prince andrew still looking into her eyes 

 is it possible that i the chit of a girl as everybody called
me thought nat sha is it possible that i am now to be the
wife and the equal of this strange dear clever man whom even my father
looks up to can it be true can it be true that there can be no
more playing with life that now i am grown up that on me now lies
a responsibility for my every word and deed yes but what did he ask
me 

 no she replied but she had not understood his question 

 forgive me he said but you are so young and i have already
been through so much in life i am afraid for you you do not yet know
yourself 

nat sha listened with concentrated attention trying but failing to
take in the meaning of his words 

 hard as this year which delays my happiness will be continued
prince andrew it will give you time to be sure of yourself i ask
you to make me happy in a year but you are free our engagement shall
remain a secret and should you find that you do not love me or should
you come to love said prince andrew with an unnatural smile 

 why do you say that nat sha interrupted him you know that
from the very day you first came to otr dnoe i have loved you she
cried quite convinced that she spoke the truth 

 in a year you will learn to know yourself 

 a whole year nat sha repeated suddenly only now realizing that
the marriage was to be postponed for a year but why a year why a
year 

prince andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay 
nat sha did not hear him 

 and can t it be helped she asked prince andrew did not reply 
but his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision 

 it s awful oh it s awful awful nat sha suddenly cried 
and again burst into sobs i shall die waiting a year it s
impossible it s awful she looked into her lover s face and saw
in it a look of commiseration and perplexity 

 no no i ll do anything she said suddenly checking her tears 
 i am so happy 

the father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed couple
their blessing 

from that day prince andrew began to frequent the rost vs as
nat sha s affianced lover 





chapter xxiv

no betrothal ceremony took place and nat sha s engagement to
bolk nski was not announced prince andrew insisted on that he said
that as he was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole
burden of it that he had given his word and bound himself forever but
that he did not wish to bind nat sha and gave her perfect freedom if
after six months she felt that she did not love him she would have full
right to reject him naturally neither nat sha nor her parents wished
to hear of this but prince andrew was firm he came every day to the
rost vs but did not behave to nat sha as an affianced lover he
did not use the familiar thou but said you to her and kissed only her
hand after their engagement quite different intimate and natural
relations sprang up between them it was as if they had not known each
other till now both liked to recall how they had regarded each other
when as yet they were nothing to one another they felt themselves
now quite different beings then they were artificial now natural and
sincere at first the family felt some constraint in intercourse with
prince andrew he seemed a man from another world and for a long time
nat sha trained the family to get used to him proudly assuring them
all that he only appeared to be different but was really just like all
of them and that she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to be 
after a few days they grew accustomed to him and without restraint in
his presence pursued their usual way of life in which he took his part 
he could talk about rural economy with the count fashions with the
countess and nat sha and about albums and fancywork with s nya 
sometimes the household both among themselves and in his presence
expressed their wonder at how it had all happened and at the evident
omens there had been of it prince andrew s coming to otr dnoe and
their coming to petersburg and the likeness between nat sha and prince
andrew which her nurse had noticed on his first visit and andrew s
encounter with nicholas in 1805 and many other incidents betokening
that it had to be 

in the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which always
accompanies the presence of a betrothed couple often when all sitting
together everyone kept silent sometimes the others would get up and
go away and the couple left alone still remained silent they rarely
spoke of their future life prince andrew was afraid and ashamed to
speak of it nat sha shared this as she did all his feelings which she
constantly divined once she began questioning him about his son prince
andrew blushed as he often did now nat sha particularly liked it in
him and said that his son would not live with them 

 why not asked nat sha in a frightened tone 

 i cannot take him away from his grandfather and besides 

 how i should have loved him said nat sha immediately guessing
his thought but i know you wish to avoid any pretext for finding
fault with us 

sometimes the old count would come up kiss prince andrew and ask
his advice about p tya s education or nicholas service the
old countess sighed as she looked at them s nya was always getting
frightened lest she should be in the way and tried to find excuses for
leaving them alone even when they did not wish it when prince andrew
spoke he could tell a story very well nat sha listened to him
with pride when she spoke she noticed with fear and joy that he gazed
attentively and scrutinizingly at her she asked herself in perplexity 
 what does he look for in me he is trying to discover something by
looking at me what if what he seeks in me is not there sometimes
she fell into one of the mad merry moods characteristic of her and
then she particularly loved to hear and see how prince andrew laughed 
he seldom laughed but when he did he abandoned himself entirely to his
laughter and after such a laugh she always felt nearer to him nat sha
would have been completely happy if the thought of the separation
awaiting her and drawing near had not terrified her just as the mere
thought of it made him turn pale and cold 

on the eve of his departure from petersburg prince andrew brought with
him pierre who had not been to the rost vs once since the ball 
pierre seemed disconcerted and embarrassed he was talking to the
countess and nat sha sat down beside a little chess table with s nya 
thereby inviting prince andrew to come too he did so 

 you have known bez khov a long time he asked do you like
him 

 yes he s a dear but very absurd 

and as usual when speaking of pierre she began to tell anecdotes of his
absent mindedness some of which had even been invented about him 

 do you know i have entrusted him with our secret i have known him
from childhood he has a heart of gold i beg you natalie prince
andrew said with sudden seriousness i am going away and heaven
knows what may happen you may cease to all right i know i am not
to say that only this then whatever may happen to you when i am not
here 

 what can happen 

 whatever trouble may come prince andrew continued i beg
you mademoiselle sophie whatever may happen to turn to him alone for
advice and help he is a most absent minded and absurd fellow but he
has a heart of gold 

neither her father nor her mother nor s nya nor prince andrew
himself could have foreseen how the separation from her lover would act
on nat sha flushed and agitated she went about the house all that day 
dry eyed occupied with most trivial matters as if not understanding
what awaited her she did not even cry when on taking leave he kissed
her hand for the last time don t go she said in a tone
that made him wonder whether he really ought not to stay and which he
remembered long afterwards nor did she cry when he was gone but
for several days she sat in her room dry eyed taking no interest in
anything and only saying now and then oh why did he go away 

but a fortnight after his departure to the surprise of those around
her she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and became
her old self again but with a change in her moral physiognomy as a
child gets up after a long illness with a changed expression of face 





chapter xxv

during that year after his son s departure prince nicholas
bolk nski s health and temper became much worse he grew still more
irritable and it was princess mary who generally bore the brunt of his
frequent fits of unprovoked anger he seemed carefully to seek out
her tender spots so as to torture her mentally as harshly as possible 
princess mary had two passions and consequently two joys her nephew 
little nicholas and religion and these were the favorite subjects
of the prince s attacks and ridicule whatever was spoken of he would
bring round to the superstitiousness of old maids or the petting
and spoiling of children you want to make him little
nicholas into an old maid like yourself a pity prince andrew
wants a son and not an old maid he would say or turning to
mademoiselle bourienne he would ask her in princess mary s presence
how she liked our village priests and icons and would joke about them 

he continually hurt princess mary s feelings and tormented her but it
cost her no effort to forgive him could he be to blame toward her or
could her father whom she knew loved her in spite of it all be unjust 
and what is justice the princess never thought of that proud word
 justice all the complex laws of man centered for her in one clear
and simple law the law of love and self sacrifice taught us by him who
lovingly suffered for mankind though he himself was god what had she to
do with the justice or injustice of other people she had to endure and
love and that she did 

during the winter prince andrew had come to bald hills and had been gay 
gentle and more affectionate than princess mary had known him for a
long time past she felt that something had happened to him but he said
nothing to her about his love before he left he had a long talk with
his father about something and princess mary noticed that before his
departure they were dissatisfied with one another 

soon after prince andrew had gone princess mary wrote to her friend
julie kar gina in petersburg whom she had dreamed as all girls dream 
of marrying to her brother and who was at that time in mourning for her
own brother killed in turkey 

sorrow it seems is our common lot my dear tender friend julie 

your loss is so terrible that i can only explain it to myself as a
special providence of god who loving you wishes to try you and your
excellent mother oh my friend religion and religion alone can i
will not say comfort us but save us from despair religion alone can
explain to us what without its help man cannot comprehend why for what
cause kind and noble beings able to find happiness in life not merely
harming no one but necessary to the happiness of others are called
away to god while cruel useless harmful persons or such as are a
burden to themselves and to others are left living the first death i
saw and one i shall never forget that of my dear sister in law left
that impression on me just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother
had to die so i asked why that angel lise who not only never wronged
anyone but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts had to
die and what do you think dear friend five years have passed since
then and already i with my petty understanding begin to see clearly
why she had to die and in what way that death was but an expression
of the infinite goodness of the creator whose every action though
generally incomprehensible to us is but a manifestation of his infinite
love for his creatures perhaps i often think she was too angelically
innocent to have the strength to perform all a mother s duties as a
young wife she was irreproachable perhaps she could not have been so
as a mother as it is not only has she left us and particularly prince
andrew with the purest regrets and memories but probably she will
there receive a place i dare not hope for myself but not to speak of
her alone that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent
influence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief then at
the moment of our loss these thoughts could not occur to me i should
then have dismissed them with horror but now they are very clear and
certain i write all this to you dear friend only to convince you
of the gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life not
a single hair of our heads will fall without his will and his will is
governed only by infinite love for us and so whatever befalls us is for
our good 

you ask whether we shall spend next winter in moscow in spite of my
wish to see you i do not think so and do not want to do so you will
be surprised to hear that the reason for this is buonaparte the case is
this my father s health is growing noticeably worse he cannot stand
any contradiction and is becoming irritable this irritability is as
you know chiefly directed to political questions he cannot endure
the notion that buonaparte is negotiating on equal terms with all the
sovereigns of europe and particularly with our own the grandson of the
great catherine as you know i am quite indifferent to politics but
from my father s remarks and his talks with michael iv novich i know
all that goes on in the world and especially about the honors conferred
on buonaparte who only at bald hills in the whole world it seems is
not accepted as a great man still less as emperor of france and my
father cannot stand this it seems to me that it is chiefly because of
his political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to
moscow for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way
of expressing his views regardless of anybody all the benefit he might
derive from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of the
disputes about buonaparte which would be inevitable in any case it will
be decided very shortly 

our family life goes on in the old way except for my brother andrew s
absence he as i wrote you before has changed very much of late after
his sorrow he only this year quite recovered his spirits he has again
become as i used to know him when a child kind affectionate with that
heart of gold to which i know no equal he has realized it seems to me 
that life is not over for him but together with this mental change
he has grown physically much weaker he has become thinner and more
nervous i am anxious about him and glad he is taking this trip abroad
which the doctors recommended long ago i hope it will cure him you
write that in petersburg he is spoken of as one of the most active 
cultivated and capable of the young men forgive my vanity as a
relation but i never doubted it the good he has done to everybody
here from his peasants up to the gentry is incalculable on his
arrival in petersburg he received only his due i always wonder at the
way rumors fly from petersburg to moscow especially such false ones as
that you write about i mean the report of my brother s betrothal to
the little rost va i do not think my brother will ever marry again 
and certainly not her and this is why first i know that though he
rarely speaks about the wife he has lost the grief of that loss
has gone too deep in his heart for him ever to decide to give her a
successor and our little angel a stepmother secondly because as far
as i know that girl is not the kind of girl who could please prince
andrew i do not think he would choose her for a wife and frankly i do
not wish it but i am running on too long and am at the end of my second
sheet good by my dear friend may god keep you in his holy and mighty
care my dear friend mademoiselle bourienne sends you kisses 

mary





chapter xxvi

in the middle of the summer princess mary received an unexpected letter
from prince andrew in switzerland in which he gave her strange and
surprising news he informed her of his engagement to nat sha rost va 
the whole letter breathed loving rapture for his betrothed and tender
and confiding affection for his sister he wrote that he had never loved
as he did now and that only now did he understand and know what life
was he asked his sister to forgive him for not having told her of his
resolve when he had last visited bald hills though he had spoken of it
to his father he had not done so for fear princess mary should ask her
father to give his consent irritating him and having to bear the brunt
of his displeasure without attaining her object besides he
wrote the matter was not then so definitely settled as it is now 
my father then insisted on a delay of a year and now already six months 
half of that period have passed and my resolution is firmer than ever 
if the doctors did not keep me here at the spas i should be back in
russia but as it is i have to postpone my return for three months you
know me and my relations with father i want nothing from him i have
been and always shall be independent but to go against his will and
arouse his anger now that he may perhaps remain with us such a short
time would destroy half my happiness i am now writing to him about
the same question and beg you to choose a good moment to hand him the
letter and to let me know how he looks at the whole matter and whether
there is hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four months 

after long hesitations doubts and prayers princess mary gave the
letter to her father the next day the old prince said to her quietly 

 write and tell your brother to wait till i am dead it won t be
long i shall soon set him free 

the princess was about to reply but her father would not let her speak
and raising his voice more and more cried 

 marry marry my boy a good family clever people eh rich 
eh yes a nice stepmother little nicholas will have write and tell him
that he may marry tomorrow if he likes she will be little nicholas 
stepmother and i ll marry bourienne ha ha ha he mustn t be
without a stepmother either only one thing no more women are wanted
in my house let him marry and live by himself perhaps you will go
and live with him too he added turning to princess mary go in
heaven s name go out into the frost the frost the frost 

after this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the matter 
but repressed vexation at his son s poor spirited behavior found
expression in his treatment of his daughter to his former pretexts
for irony a fresh one was now added allusions to stepmothers and
amiabilities to mademoiselle bourienne 

 why shouldn t i marry her he asked his daughter she ll
make a splendid princess 

and latterly to her surprise and bewilderment princess mary
noticed that her father was really associating more and more with the
frenchwoman she wrote to prince andrew about the reception of his
letter but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to the
idea 

little nicholas and his education her brother andrew and religion
were princess mary s joys and consolations but besides that since
everyone must have personal hopes princess mary in the profoundest
depths of her heart had a hidden dream and hope that supplied the chief
consolation of her life this comforting dream and hope were given her
by god s folk the half witted and other pilgrims who visited
her without the prince s knowledge the longer she lived the more
experience and observation she had of life the greater was her wonder
at the short sightedness of men who seek enjoyment and happiness here
on earth toiling suffering struggling and harming one another to
obtain that impossible visionary sinful happiness prince andrew had
loved his wife she died but that was not enough he wanted to bind
his happiness to another woman her father objected to this because he
wanted a more distinguished and wealthier match for andrew and they
all struggled and suffered and tormented one another and injured their
souls their eternal souls for the attainment of benefits which endure
but for an instant not only do we know this ourselves but christ the
son of god came down to earth and told us that this life is but for
a moment and is a probation yet we cling to it and think to find
happiness in it how is it that no one realizes this thought
princess mary no one except these despised god s folk who wallet
on back come to me by the back door afraid of being seen by the
prince not for fear of ill usage by him but for fear of causing him
to sin to leave family home and all the cares of worldly welfare in
order without clinging to anything to wander in hempen rags from place
to place under an assumed name doing no one any harm but praying for
all for those who drive one away as well as for those who protect one 
higher than that life and truth there is no life or truth 

there was one pilgrim a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty called
theodosia who for over thirty years had gone about barefoot and worn
heavy chains princess mary was particularly fond of her once when in
a room with a lamp dimly lit before the icon theodosia was talking of
her life the thought that theodosia alone had found the true path of
life suddenly came to princess mary with such force that she resolved to
become a pilgrim herself when theodosia had gone to sleep princess mary
thought about this for a long time and at last made up her mind that 
strange as it might seem she must go on a pilgrimage she disclosed
this thought to no one but to her confessor father ak nfi the monk 
and he approved of her intention under guise of a present for the
pilgrims princess mary prepared a pilgrim s complete costume for
herself a coarse smock bast shoes a rough coat and a black kerchief 
often approaching the chest of drawers containing this secret treasure 
princess mary paused uncertain whether the time had not already come to
put her project into execution 

often listening to the pilgrims tales she was so stimulated by
their simple speech mechanical to them but to her so full of deep
meaning that several times she was on the point of abandoning
everything and running away from home in imagination she already
pictured herself by theodosia s side dressed in coarse rags walking
with a staff a wallet on her back along the dusty road directing her
wanderings from one saint s shrine to another free from envy earthly
love or desire and reaching at last the place where there is no more
sorrow or sighing but eternal joy and bliss 

 i shall come to a place and pray there and before having time to get
used to it or getting to love it i shall go farther i will go on till
my legs fail and i ll lie down and die somewhere and shall at last
reach that eternal quiet haven where there is neither sorrow nor
sighing thought princess mary 

but afterwards when she saw her father and especially little koko
 nicholas her resolve weakened she wept quietly and felt that she
was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than god 





book seven 1810 11





chapter i

the bible legend tells us that the absence of labor idleness was a
condition of the first man s blessedness before the fall fallen man
has retained a love of idleness but the curse weighs on the race not
only because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows but
because our moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at
ease an inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle if man
could find a state in which he felt that though idle he was fulfilling
his duty he would have found one of the conditions of man s primitive
blessedness and such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idleness
is the lot of a whole class the military the chief attraction of
military service has consisted and will consist in this compulsory and
irreproachable idleness 

nicholas rost v experienced this blissful condition to the full when 
after 1807 he continued to serve in the p vlograd regiment in which
he already commanded the squadron he had taken over from den sov 

rost v had become a bluff good natured fellow whom his moscow
acquaintances would have considered rather bad form but who was liked
and respected by his comrades subordinates and superiors and was well
contented with his life of late in 1809 he found in letters from home
more frequent complaints from his mother that their affairs were falling
into greater and greater disorder and that it was time for him to come
back to gladden and comfort his old parents 

reading these letters nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to
take him away from surroundings in which protected from all the
entanglements of life he was living so calmly and quietly he felt that
sooner or later he would have to re enter that whirlpool of life with
its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out its accounts
with stewards quarrels and intrigues its ties society and with
s nya s love and his promise to her it was all dreadfully difficult
and complicated and he replied to his mother in cold formal letters
in french beginning my dear mamma and ending your obedient
son which said nothing of when he would return in 1810 he received
letters from his parents in which they told him of nat sha s
engagement to bolk nski and that the wedding would be in a year s
time because the old prince made difficulties this letter grieved and
mortified nicholas in the first place he was sorry that nat sha for
whom he cared more than for anyone else in the family should be lost to
the home and secondly from his hussar point of view he regretted not
to have been there to show that fellow bolk nski that connection with
him was no such great honor after all and that if he loved nat sha he
might dispense with permission from his dotard father for a moment he
hesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see nat sha
before she was married but then came the maneuvers and considerations
about s nya and about the confusion of their affairs and nicholas
again put it off but in the spring of that year he received a letter
from his mother written without his father s knowledge and that
letter persuaded him to return she wrote that if he did not come and
take matters in hand their whole property would be sold by auction and
they would all have to go begging the count was so weak and trusted
m tenka so much and was so good natured that everybody took advantage
of him and things were going from bad to worse for god s sake i
implore you come at once if you do not wish to make me and the whole
family wretched wrote the countess 

this letter touched nicholas he had that common sense of a
matter of fact man which showed him what he ought to do 

the right thing now was if not to retire from the service at any rate
to go home on leave why he had to go he did not know but after his
after dinner nap he gave orders to saddle mars an extremely vicious
gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time and when
he returned with the horse all in a lather he informed lavr shka
 den sov s servant who had remained with him and his comrades who
turned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was going
home difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he would
go away without having heard from the staff and this interested him
extremely whether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive the
order of st anne for the last maneuvers strange as it was to think
that he would go away without having sold his three roans to the polish
count golukhovski who was bargaining for the horses rost v had betted
he would sell for two thousand rubles incomprehensible as it
seemed that the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the polish
mademoiselle przazdziecka out of rivalry to the uhlans who had given
one in honor of their polish mademoiselle borzozowska would take place
without him he knew he must go away from this good bright world to
somewhere where everything was stupid and confused a week later he
obtained his leave his hussar comrades not only those of his own
regiment but the whole brigade gave rost v a dinner to which the
subscription was fifteen rubles a head and at which there were two
bands and two choirs of singers rost v danced the trep k with major
b sov the tipsy officers tossed embraced and dropped rost v the
soldiers of the third squadron tossed him too and shouted hurrah 
and then they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as far as the first
post station 

during the first half of the journey from kremench g to kiev all
rost v s thoughts as is usual in such cases were behind him with
the squadron but when he had gone more than halfway he began to forget
his three roans and dozhoyv yko his quartermaster and to wonder
anxiously how things would be at otr dnoe and what he would find
there thoughts of home grew stronger the nearer he approached it far
stronger as though this feeling of his was subject to the law by which
the force of attraction is in inverse proportion to the square of the
distance at the last post station before otr dnoe he gave the driver a
three ruble tip and on arriving he ran breathlessly like a boy up the
steps of his home 

after the rapture of meeting and after that odd feeling of unsatisfied
expectation the feeling that everything is just the same so why
did i hurry nicholas began to settle down in his old home world 
his father and mother were much the same only a little older what was
new in them was a certain uneasiness and occasional discord which there
used not to be and which as nicholas soon found out was due to the
bad state of their affairs s nya was nearly twenty she had stopped
growing prettier and promised nothing more than she was already but
that was enough she exhaled happiness and love from the time nicholas
returned and the faithful unalterable love of this girl had a
gladdening effect on him p tya and nat sha surprised nicholas
most p tya was a big handsome boy of thirteen merry witty and
mischievous with a voice that was already breaking as for nat sha 
for a long while nicholas wondered and laughed whenever he looked at
her 

 you re not the same at all he said 

 how am i uglier 

 on the contrary but what dignity a princess he whispered to
her 

 yes yes yes cried nat sha joyfully 

she told him about her romance with prince andrew and of his visit to
otr dnoe and showed him his last letter 

 well are you glad nat sha asked i am so tranquil and happy
now 

 very glad answered nicholas he is an excellent fellow and
are you very much in love 

 how shall i put it replied nat sha i was in love with
bor s with my teacher and with den sov but this is quite different 
i feel at peace and settled i know that no better man than he exists 
and i am calm and contented now not at all as before 

nicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of the marriage
for a year but nat sha attacked her brother with exasperation proving
to him that it could not be otherwise and that it would be a bad thing
to enter a family against the father s will and that she herself
wished it so 

 you don t at all understand she said 

nicholas was silent and agreed with her 

her brother often wondered as he looked at her she did not seem at
all like a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband she was
even tempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old this amazed
nicholas and even made him regard bolk nski s courtship skeptically 
he could not believe that her fate was sealed especially as he had
not seen her with prince andrew it always seemed to him that there was
something not quite right about this intended marriage 

 why this delay why no betrothal he thought once when he had
touched on this topic with his mother he discovered to his surprise
and somewhat to his satisfaction that in the depth of her soul she too
had doubts about this marriage 

 you see he writes said she showing her son a letter of prince
andrew s with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to a
daughter s future married happiness he writes that he won t come
before december what can be keeping him illness probably his health
is very delicate don t tell nat sha and don t attach importance
to her being so bright that s because she s living through the last
days of her girlhood but i know what she is like every time we receive
a letter from him however god grant that everything turns out well 
 she always ended with these words he is an excellent man 





chapter ii

after reaching home nicholas was at first serious and even dull he was
worried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid business
matters for which his mother had called him home to throw off this
burden as quickly as possible on the third day after his arrival he
went angry and scowling and without answering questions as to where he
was going to m tenka s lodge and demanded an account of everything 
but what an account of everything might be nicholas knew even less
than the frightened and bewildered m tenka the conversation and the
examination of the accounts with m tenka did not last long the village
elder a peasant delegate and the village clerk who were waiting in
the passage heard with fear and delight first the young count s voice
roaring and snapping and rising louder and louder and then words of
abuse dreadful words ejaculated one after the other 

 robber ungrateful wretch i ll hack the dog to pieces i m
not my father robbing us and so on 

then with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count red in
the face and with bloodshot eyes dragged m tenka out by the scruff of
the neck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with great agility
at convenient moments between the words shouting be off never let
me see your face here again you villain 

m tenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the
shrubbery this shrubbery was a well known haven of refuge for culprits
at otr dnoe m tenka himself returning tipsy from the town used
to hide there and many of the residents at otr dnoe hiding from
m tenka knew of its protective qualities 

m tenka s wife and sisters in law thrust their heads and frightened
faces out of the door of a room where a bright samovar was boiling and
where the steward s high bedstead stood with its patchwork quilt 

the young count paid no heed to them but breathing hard passed by
with resolute strides and went into the house 

the countess who heard at once from the maids what had happened at the
lodge was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would certainly
improve but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect this
excitement might have on her son she went several times to his door on
tiptoe and listened as he lighted one pipe after another 

next day the old count called his son aside and with an embarrassed
smile said to him 

 but you know my dear boy it s a pity you got excited m tenka
has told me all about it 

 i knew thought nicholas that i should never understand
anything in this crazy world 

 you were angry that he had not entered those 700 rubles but they
were carried forward and you did not look at the other page 

 papa he is a blackguard and a thief i know he is and what i have
done i have done but if you like i won t speak to him again 

 no my dear boy the count too felt embarrassed he knew he had
mismanaged his wife s property and was to blame toward his children 
but he did not know how to remedy it no i beg you to attend to the
business i am old i 

 no papa forgive me if i have caused you unpleasantness i
understand it all less than you do 

 devil take all these peasants and money matters and carryings
forward from page to page he thought i used to understand what
a corner and the stakes at cards meant but carrying forward to
another page i don t understand at all said he to himself and
after that he did not meddle in business affairs but once the countess
called her son and informed him that she had a promissory note from anna
mikh ylovna for two thousand rubles and asked him what he thought of
doing with it 

 this answered nicholas you say it rests with me well i
don t like anna mikh ylovna and i don t like bor s but they were
our friends and poor well then this and he tore up the note and
by so doing caused the old countess to weep tears of joy after that 
young rost v took no further part in any business affairs but
devoted himself with passionate enthusiasm to what was to him a new
pursuit the chase for which his father kept a large establishment 





chapter iii

the weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts congealed
an earth saturated by autumn rains the verdure had thickened and its
bright green stood out sharply against the brownish strips of winter rye
trodden down by the cattle and against the pale yellow stubble of the
spring buckwheat the wooded ravines and the copses which at the end of
august had still been green islands amid black fields and stubble had
become golden and bright red islands amid the green winter rye the
hares had already half changed their summer coats the fox cubs were
beginning to scatter and the young wolves were bigger than dogs it was
the best time of the year for the chase the hounds of that ardent young
sportsman rost v had not merely reached hard winter condition but were
so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them
a three days rest and then on the sixteenth of september to go on
a distant expedition starting from the oak grove where there was an
undisturbed litter of wolf cubs 

all that day the hounds remained at home it was frosty and the air was
sharp but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began to thaw 
on the fifteenth when young rost v in his dressing gown looked out
of the window he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for hunting it
was as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth without any
wind the only motion in the air was that of the dripping microscopic
particles of drizzling mist the bare twigs in the garden were hung with
transparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves the earth in
the kitchen garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy seed
and at a short distance merged into the dull moist veil of mist 
nicholas went out into the wet and muddy porch there was a smell of
decaying leaves and of dog m lka a black spotted broad haunched
bitch with prominent black eyes got up on seeing her master stretched
her hind legs lay down like a hare and then suddenly jumped up and
licked him right on his nose and mustache another borzoi a dog 
catching sight of his master from the garden path arched his back
and rushing headlong toward the porch with lifted tail began rubbing
himself against his legs 

 o hoy came at that moment that inimitable huntsman s call
which unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor and round
the corner came daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman a gray 
wrinkled old man with hair cut straight over his forehead ukrainian
fashion a long bent whip in his hand and that look of independence
and scorn of everything that is only seen in huntsmen he doffed his
circassian cap to his master and looked at him scornfully this scorn
was not offensive to his master nicholas knew that this daniel 
disdainful of everybody and who considered himself above them was all
the same his serf and huntsman 

 daniel nicholas said timidly conscious at the sight of the
weather the hounds and the huntsman that he was being carried away
by that irresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all
his previous resolutions as a lover forgets in the presence of his
mistress 

 what orders your excellency said the huntsman in his deep bass 
deep as a proto deacon s and hoarse with hallooing and two flashing
black eyes gazed from under his brows at his master who was silent 
 can you resist it those eyes seemed to be asking 

 it s a good day eh for a hunt and a gallop eh asked
nicholas scratching m lka behind the ears 

daniel did not answer but winked instead 

 i sent uv rka at dawn to listen his bass boomed out after a
minute s pause he says she s moved them into the otr dnoe
enclosure they were howling there this meant that the she wolf 
about whom they both knew had moved with her cubs to the otr dnoe
copse a small place a mile and a half from the house 

 we ought to go don t you think so said nicholas come to me
with uv rka 

 as you please 

 then put off feeding them 

 yes sir 

five minutes later daniel and uv rka were standing in nicholas big
study though daniel was not a big man to see him in a room was
like seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and
surroundings of human life daniel himself felt this and as usual stood
just inside the door trying to speak softly and not move for fear of
breaking something in the master s apartment and he hastened to say
all that was necessary so as to get from under that ceiling out into
the open under the sky once more 

having finished his inquiries and extorted from daniel an opinion that
the hounds were fit daniel himself wished to go hunting nicholas
ordered the horses to be saddled but just as daniel was about to
go nat sha came in with rapid steps not having done up her hair or
finished dressing and with her old nurse s big shawl wrapped round
her p tya ran in at the same time 

 you are going asked nat sha i knew you would s nya said
you wouldn t go but i knew that today is the sort of day when you
couldn t help going 

 yes we are going replied nicholas reluctantly for today as he
intended to hunt seriously he did not want to take nat sha and p tya 
 we are going but only wolf hunting it would be dull for you 

 you know it is my greatest pleasure said nat sha it s not
fair you are going by yourself are having the horses saddled and said
nothing to us about it 

 no barrier bars a russian s path we ll go shouted
p tya 

 but you can t mamma said you mustn t said nicholas to
nat sha 

 yes i ll go i shall certainly go said nat sha decisively 
 daniel tell them to saddle for us and michael must come with my
dogs she added to the huntsman 

it seemed to daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all but to
have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible he
cast down his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his business 
careful as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on the young
lady 





chapter iv

the old count who had always kept up an enormous hunting establishment
but had now handed it all completely over to his son s care being
in very good spirits on this fifteenth of september prepared to go out
with the others 

in an hour s time the whole hunting party was at the porch nicholas 
with a stern and serious air which showed that now was no time for
attending to trifles went past nat sha and p tya who were trying to
tell him something he had a look at all the details of the hunt sent
a pack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the quarry mounted his
chestnut don ts and whistling to his own leash of borzois set off
across the threshing ground to a field leading to the otr dnoe wood 
the old count s horse a sorrel gelding called vifly nka was led by
the groom in attendance on him while the count himself was to drive in
a small trap straight to a spot reserved for him 

they were taking fifty four hounds with six hunt attendants and
whippers in besides the family there were eight borzoi kennelmen
and more than forty borzois so that with the borzois on the leash
belonging to members of the family there were about a hundred and
thirty dogs and twenty horsemen 

each dog knew its master and its call each man in the hunt knew his
business his place what he had to do as soon as they had passed the
fence they all spread out evenly and quietly without noise or talk 
along the road and field leading to the otr dnoe covert 

the horses stepped over the field as over a thick carpet now and then
splashing into puddles as they crossed a road the misty sky still
seemed to descend evenly and imperceptibly toward the earth the air
was still warm and silent occasionally the whistle of a huntsman 
the snort of a horse the crack of a whip or the whine of a straggling
hound could be heard 

when they had gone a little less than a mile five more riders with
dogs appeared out of the mist approaching the rost vs in front rode a
fresh looking handsome old man with a large gray mustache 

 good morning uncle said nicholas when the old man drew near 

 that s it come on i was sure of it began uncle he
was a distant relative of the rost vs a man of small means and
their neighbor i knew you wouldn t be able to resist it and
it s a good thing you re going that s it come on this was
 uncle s favorite expression take the covert at once for my
g rchik says the il gins are at kornik with their hounds that s
it come on they ll take the cubs from under your very nose 

 that s where i m going shall we join up our packs asked
nicholas 

the hounds were joined into one pack and uncle and nicholas rode
on side by side nat sha muffled up in shawls which did not hide her
eager face and shining eyes galloped up to them she was followed by
p tya who always kept close to her by michael a huntsman and by a
groom appointed to look after her p tya who was laughing whipped and
pulled at his horse nat sha sat easily and confidently on her black
ar bchik and reined him in without effort with a firm hand 

 uncle looked round disapprovingly at p tya and nat sha he did
not like to combine frivolity with the serious business of hunting 

 good morning uncle we are going too shouted p tya 

 good morning good morning but don t go overriding the hounds 
said uncle sternly 

 nicholas what a fine dog trun la is he knew me said nat sha 
referring to her favorite hound 

 in the first place trun la is not a dog but a harrier 
thought nicholas and looked sternly at his sister trying to make her
feel the distance that ought to separate them at that moment nat sha
understood it 

 you mustn t think we ll be in anyone s way uncle she said 
 we ll go to our places and won t budge 

 a good thing too little countess said uncle only mind
you don t fall off your horse he added because that s it 
come on you ve nothing to hold on to 

the oasis of the otr dnoe covert came in sight a few hundred yards off 
the huntsmen were already nearing it rost v having finally settled
with uncle where they should set on the hounds and having shown
nat sha where she was to stand a spot where nothing could possibly
run out went round above the ravine 

 well nephew you re going for a big wolf said uncle 
 mind and don t let her slip 

 that s as may happen answered rost v kar y here he
shouted answering uncle s remark by this call to his borzoi 
kar y was a shaggy old dog with a hanging jowl famous for having
tackled a big wolf unaided they all took up their places 

the old count knowing his son s ardor in the hunt hurried so as not
to be late and the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when count
ily rost v cheerful flushed and with quivering cheeks drove up
with his black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for him 
where a wolf might come out having straightened his coat and fastened
on his hunting knives and horn he mounted his good sleek well fed 
and comfortable horse vifly nka which was turning gray like himself 
his horses and trap were sent home count ily rost v though not at
heart a keen sportsman knew the rules of the hunt well and rode to
the bushy edge of the road where he was to stand arranged his reins 
settled himself in the saddle and feeling that he was ready looked
about with a smile 

beside him was simon chekm r his personal attendant an old horseman
now somewhat stiff in the saddle chekm r held in leash three
formidable wolfhounds who had however grown fat like their master
and his horse two wise old dogs lay down unleashed some hundred paces
farther along the edge of the wood stood m tka the count s other
groom a daring horseman and keen rider to hounds before the hunt by
old custom the count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled brandy taken
a snack and washed it down with half a bottle of his favorite bordeaux 

he was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive his eyes were
rather moist and glittered more than usual and as he sat in his saddle 
wrapped up in his fur coat he looked like a child taken out for an
outing 

the thin hollow cheeked chekm r having got everything ready kept
glancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of terms for
thirty years and understanding the mood he was in expected a pleasant
chat a third person rode up circumspectly through the wood it was
plain that he had had a lesson and stopped behind the count this
person was a gray bearded old man in a woman s cloak with a tall
peaked cap on his head he was the buffoon who went by a woman s
name nast sya iv novna 

 well nast sya iv novna whispered the count winking at him 
 if you scare away the beast daniel ll give it you 

 i know a thing or two myself said nast sya iv novna 

 hush whispered the count and turned to simon have you seen
the young countess he asked where is she 

 with young count peter by the zh rov rank grass answered simon 
smiling though she s a lady she s very fond of hunting 

 and you re surprised at the way she rides simon eh said the
count she s as good as many a man 

 of course it s marvelous so bold so easy 

 and nicholas where is he by the ly dov upland isn t he 

 yes sir he knows where to stand he understands the matter so well
that daniel and i are often quite astounded said simon well knowing
what would please his master 

 rides well eh and how well he looks on his horse eh 

 a perfect picture how he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the
zav rzinsk thicket the other day leaped a fearful place what a sight
when they rushed from the covert the horse worth a thousand rubles
and the rider beyond all price yes one would have to search far to
find another as smart 

 to search far repeated the count evidently sorry simon had not
said more to search far he said turning back the skirt of his
coat to get at his snuffbox 

 the other day when he came out from mass in full uniform michael
sid rych simon did not finish for on the still air he had
distinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three hounds
giving tongue he bent down his head and listened shaking a warning
finger at his master they are on the scent of the cubs he
whispered straight to the ly dov uplands 

the count forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face looked into
the distance straight before him down the narrow open space holding
the snuffbox in his hand but not taking any after the cry of the hounds
came the deep tones of the wolf call from daniel s hunting horn the
pack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry 
with that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after
a wolf the whippers in no longer set on the hounds but changed to the
cry of ulyulyu and above the others rose daniel s voice now a deep
bass now piercingly shrill his voice seemed to fill the whole wood and
carried far beyond out into the open field 

after listening a few moments in silence the count and his attendant
convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs the
sound of the larger pack eagerly giving tongue began to die away in
the distance the other pack rushed by the wood past the count and
it was with this that daniel s voice was heard calling ulyulyu 
the sounds of both packs mingled and broke apart again but both were
becoming more distant 

simon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had
entangled the count too sighed and noticing the snuffbox in his hand 
opened it and took a pinch back cried simon to a borzoi that
was pushing forward out of the wood the count started and dropped the
snuffbox nast sya iv novna dismounted to pick it up the count and
simon were looking at him 

then unexpectedly as often happens the sound of the hunt suddenly
approached as if the hounds in full cry and daniel ulyulyuing were just
in front of them 

the count turned and saw on his right m tka staring at him with eyes
starting out of his head raising his cap and pointing before him to the
other side 

 look out he shouted in a voice plainly showing that he had long
fretted to utter that word and letting the borzois slip he galloped
toward the count 

the count and simon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left a
wolf which softly swaying from side to side was coming at a quiet
lope farther to the left to the very place where they were standing 
the angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the
horses feet at the wolf 

the wolf paused turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardly 
like a man suffering from the quinsy and still slightly swaying
from side to side gave a couple of leaps and with a swish of its tail
disappeared into the skirt of the wood at the same instant with a cry
like a wail first one hound then another and then another sprang
helter skelter from the wood opposite and the whole pack rushed across
the field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared the hazel
bushes parted behind the hounds and daniel s chestnut horse appeared 
dark with sweat on its long back sat daniel hunched forward capless 
his disheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed perspiring face 

 ulyulyulyu ulyulyu he cried when he caught sight of the
count his eyes flashed lightning 

 blast you he shouted holding up his whip threateningly at the
count 

 you ve let the wolf go what sportsmen and as if scorning to
say more to the frightened and shamefaced count he lashed the heaving
flanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count
had aroused and flew off after the hounds the count like a punished
schoolboy looked round trying by a smile to win simon s sympathy for
his plight but simon was no longer there he was galloping round by the
bushes while the field was coming up on both sides all trying to head
the wolf but it vanished into the wood before they could do so 





chapter v

nicholas rost v meanwhile remained at his post waiting for the wolf 
by the way the hunt approached and receded by the cries of the dogs
whose notes were familiar to him by the way the voices of the huntsmen
approached receded and rose he realized what was happening at the
copse he knew that young and old wolves were there that the hounds had
separated into two packs that somewhere a wolf was being chased and
that something had gone wrong he expected the wolf to come his way any
moment he made thousands of different conjectures as to where and
from what side the beast would come and how he would set upon it hope
alternated with despair several times he addressed a prayer to god
that the wolf should come his way he prayed with that passionate and
shamefaced feeling with which men pray at moments of great excitement
arising from trivial causes what would it be to thee to do this for
me he said to god i know thou art great and that it is a sin to
ask this of thee but for god s sake do let the old wolf come my way
and let kar y spring at it in sight of uncle who is watching
from over there and seize it by the throat in a death grip a
thousand times during that half hour rost v cast eager and restless
glances over the edge of the wood with the two scraggy oaks rising
above the aspen undergrowth and the gully with its water worn side and
 uncle s cap just visible above the bush on his right 

 no i shan t have such luck thought rost v yet what
wouldn t it be worth it is not to be everywhere at cards and in
war i am always unlucky memories of austerlitz and of d lokhov
flashed rapidly and clearly through his mind only once in my life
to get an old wolf i want only that thought he straining eyes and
ears and looking to the left and then to the right and listening to the
slightest variation of note in the cries of the dogs 

again he looked to the right and saw something running toward him across
the deserted field no it can t be thought rost v taking a
deep breath as a man does at the coming of something long hoped for 
the height of happiness was reached and so simply without warning or
noise or display that rost v could not believe his eyes and remained
in doubt for over a second the wolf ran forward and jumped heavily over
a gully that lay in her path she was an old animal with a gray back and
big reddish belly she ran without hurry evidently feeling sure that no
one saw her rost v holding his breath looked round at the borzois 
they stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situation 
old kar y had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas 
baring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs 

 ulyulyulyu whispered rost v pouting his lips the borzois
jumped up jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears 
kar y finished scratching his hindquarters and cocking his ears got
up with quivering tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down 

 shall i loose them or not nicholas asked himself as the wolf
approached him coming from the copse suddenly the wolf s whole
physiognomy changed she shuddered seeing what she had probably never
seen before human eyes fixed upon her and turning her head a little
toward rost v she paused 

 back or forward eh no matter forward the wolf seemed to say
to herself and she moved forward without again looking round and with a
quiet long easy yet resolute lope 

 ulyulyu cried nicholas in a voice not his own and of its own
accord his good horse darted headlong downhill leaping over gullies
to head off the wolf and the borzois passed it running faster still 
nicholas did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping nor
see the borzois nor the ground over which he went he saw only the
wolf who increasing her speed bounded on in the same direction along
the hollow the first to come into view was m lka with her black
markings and powerful quarters gaining upon the wolf nearer and
nearer now she was ahead of it but the wolf turned its head to face
her and instead of putting on speed as she usually did m lka suddenly
raised her tail and stiffened her forelegs 

 ulyulyulyulyu shouted nicholas 

the reddish lyub m rushed forward from behind m lka sprang
impetuously at the wolf and seized it by its hindquarters but
immediately jumped aside in terror the wolf crouched gnashed her
teeth and again rose and bounded forward followed at the distance of a
couple of feet by all the borzois who did not get any closer to her 

 she ll get away no it s impossible thought nicholas still
shouting with a hoarse voice 

 kar y ulyulyu he shouted looking round for the old borzoi
who was now his only hope kar y with all the strength age had left
him stretched himself to the utmost and watching the wolf galloped
heavily aside to intercept it but the quickness of the wolf s
lope and the borzoi s slower pace made it plain that kar y had
miscalculated nicholas could already see not far in front of him the
wood where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach it but 
coming toward him he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost
straight at the wolf there was still hope a long yellowish
young borzoi one nicholas did not know from another leash rushed
impetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked her over but
the wolf jumped up more quickly than anyone could have expected and 
gnashing her teeth flew at the yellowish borzoi which with a piercing
yelp fell with its head on the ground bleeding from a gash in its
side 

 kar y old fellow wailed nicholas 

thanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolf s path the
old dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within five
paces of it as if aware of her danger the wolf turned her eyes on
kar y tucked her tail yet further between her legs and increased
her speed but here nicholas only saw that something happened to
kar y the borzoi was suddenly on the wolf and they rolled together
down into a gully just in front of them 

that instant when nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully
with the dogs while from under them could be seen her gray hair and
outstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head with her ears
laid back kar y was pinning her by the throat was the happiest
moment of his life with his hand on his saddlebow he was ready to
dismount and stab the wolf when she suddenly thrust her head up from
among that mass of dogs and then her forepaws were on the edge of the
gully she clicked her teeth kar y no longer had her by the throat 
leaped with a movement of her hind legs out of the gully and having
disengaged herself from the dogs with tail tucked in again went
forward kar y his hair bristling and probably bruised or wounded 
climbed with difficulty out of the gully 

 oh my god why nicholas cried in despair 

 uncle s huntsman was galloping from the other side across the
wolf s path and his borzois once more stopped the animal s advance 
she was again hemmed in 

nicholas and his attendant with uncle and his huntsman were all
riding round the wolf crying ulyulyu shouting and preparing to
dismount each moment that the wolf crouched back and starting forward
again every time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she
would be safe 

already at the beginning of this chase daniel hearing the ulyulyuing 
had rushed out from the wood he saw kar y seize the wolf and checked
his horse supposing the affair to be over but when he saw that the
horsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself and ran for
safety daniel set his chestnut galloping not at the wolf but straight
toward the wood just as kar y had run to cut the animal off as
a result of this he galloped up to the wolf just when she had been
stopped a second time by uncle s borzois 

daniel galloped up silently holding a naked dagger in his left hand and
thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as if
it were a flail 

nicholas neither saw nor heard daniel until the chestnut breathing
heavily panted past him and he heard the fall of a body and saw daniel
lying on the wolf s back among the dogs trying to seize her by the
ears it was evident to the dogs the hunters and to the wolf herself
that all was now over the terrified wolf pressed back her ears and
tried to rise but the borzois stuck to her daniel rose a little took
a step and with his whole weight as if lying down to rest fell on
the wolf seizing her by the ears nicholas was about to stab her but
daniel whispered don t we ll gag her and changing his
position set his foot on the wolf s neck a stick was thrust between
her jaws and she was fastened with a leash as if bridled her legs were
bound together and daniel rolled her over once or twice from side to
side 

with happy exhausted faces they laid the old wolf alive on a shying
and snorting horse and accompanied by the dogs yelping at her took her
to the place where they were all to meet the hounds had killed two of
the cubs and the borzois three the huntsmen assembled with their booty
and their stories and all came to look at the wolf which with her
broad browed head hanging down and the bitten stick between her jaws 
gazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd of dogs and men surrounding
her when she was touched she jerked her bound legs and looked wildly
yet simply at everybody old count rost v also rode up and touched the
wolf 

 oh what a formidable one said he a formidable one eh he
asked daniel who was standing near 

 yes your excellency answered daniel quickly doffing his cap 

the count remembered the wolf he had let slip and his encounter with
daniel 

 ah but you are a crusty fellow friend said the count 

for sole reply daniel gave him a shy childlike meek and amiable
smile 





chapter vi

the old count went home and nat sha and p tya promised to return very
soon but as it was still early the hunt went farther at midday
they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees 
nicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his whips 

facing him lay a field of winter rye there his own huntsman stood alone
in a hollow behind a hazel bush the hounds had scarcely been loosed
before nicholas heard one he knew volt rn giving tongue at intervals 
other hounds joined in now pausing and now again giving tongue a
moment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a fox had been
found and the whole pack joining together rushed along the ravine
toward the ryefield and away from nicholas 

he saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the
ravine he even saw the hounds and was expecting a fox to show itself
at any moment on the ryefield opposite 

the huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois and
nicholas saw a queer short legged red fox with a fine brush going hard
across the field the borzois bore down on it now they drew close
to the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper
curves trailing its brush when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed
in followed by a black one and everything was in confusion the borzois
formed a star shaped figure scarcely swaying their bodies and with
tails turned away from the center of the group two huntsmen galloped up
to the dogs one in a red cap the other a stranger in a green coat 

 what s this thought nicholas where s that huntsman from 
he is not uncle s man 

the huntsmen got the fox but stayed there a long time without strapping
it to the saddle their horses bridled and with high saddles stood
near them and there too the dogs were lying the huntsmen waved their
arms and did something to the fox then from that spot came the sound of
a horn with the signal agreed on in case of a fight 

 that s il gin s huntsman having a row with our iv n said
nicholas groom 

nicholas sent the man to call nat sha and p tya to him and rode at a
footpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds together 
several of the field galloped to the spot where the fight was going on 

nicholas dismounted and with nat sha and p tya who had ridden up 
stopped near the hounds waiting to see how the matter would end out of
the bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward
his young master with the fox tied to his crupper while still at a
distance he took off his cap and tried to speak respectfully but he was
pale and breathless and his face was angry one of his eyes was black 
but he probably was not even aware of it 

 what has happened asked nicholas 

 a likely thing killing a fox our dogs had hunted and it was my gray
bitch that caught it go to law indeed he snatches at the fox i
gave him one with the fox here it is on my saddle do you want a taste
of this said the huntsman pointing to his dagger and probably
imagining himself still speaking to his foe 

nicholas not stopping to talk to the man asked his sister and p tya
to wait for him and rode to the spot where the enemy s il gin s 
hunting party was 

the victorious huntsman rode off to join the field and there 
surrounded by inquiring sympathizers recounted his exploits 

the facts were that il gin with whom the rost vs had a quarrel and
were at law hunted over places that belonged by custom to the rost vs 
and had now as if purposely sent his men to the very woods the
rost vs were hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs had
chased 

nicholas though he had never seen il gin with his usual absence
of moderation in judgment hated him cordially from reports of his
arbitrariness and violence and regarded him as his bitterest foe he
rode in angry agitation toward him firmly grasping his whip and fully
prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish his
enemy 

hardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in
a beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome raven black horse 
accompanied by two hunt servants 

instead of an enemy nicholas found in il gin a stately and courteous
gentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young count s
acquaintance having ridden up to nicholas il gin raised his beaver
cap and said he much regretted what had occurred and would have the
man punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone
else s borzois he hoped to become better acquainted with the count
and invited him to draw his covert 

nat sha afraid that her brother would do something dreadful had
followed him in some excitement seeing the enemies exchanging friendly
greetings she rode up to them il gin lifted his beaver cap still
higher to nat sha and said with a pleasant smile that the young
countess resembled diana in her passion for the chase as well as in her
beauty of which he had heard much 

to expiate his huntsman s offense il gin pressed the rost vs to
come to an upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for
himself and which he said swarmed with hares nicholas agreed and the
hunt now doubled moved on 

the way to iligin s upland was across the fields the hunt servants
fell into line the masters rode together uncle rost v and
il gin kept stealthily glancing at one another s dogs trying not
to be observed by their companions and searching uneasily for rivals to
their own borzois 

rost v was particularly struck by the beauty of a small pure bred 
red spotted bitch on il gin s leash slender but with muscles like
steel a delicate muzzle and prominent black eyes he had heard of
the swiftness of il gin s borzois and in that beautiful bitch saw a
rival to his own m lka 

in the middle of a sober conversation begun by il gin about the
year s harvest nicholas pointed to the red spotted bitch 

 a fine little bitch that said he in a careless tone is she
swift 

 that one yes she s a good dog gets what she s after 
answered il gin indifferently of the red spotted bitch erz for
which a year before he had given a neighbor three families of house
serfs so in your parts too the harvest is nothing to boast of 
count he went on continuing the conversation they had begun and
considering it polite to return the young count s compliment il gin
looked at his borzois and picked out m lka who attracted his attention
by her breadth that black spotted one of yours is fine well
shaped said he 

 yes she s fast enough replied nicholas and thought if
only a full grown hare would cross the field now i d show you what
sort of borzoi she is and turning to his groom he said he would
give a ruble to anyone who found a hare 

 i don t understand continued il gin how some sportsmen can
be so jealous about game and dogs for myself i can tell you count 
i enjoy riding in company such as this what could be better he
again raised his cap to nat sha but as for counting skins and what
one takes i don t care about that 

 of course not 

 or being upset because someone else s borzoi and not mine catches
something all i care about is to enjoy seeing the chase is it not so 
count for i consider that 

 a tu came the long drawn cry of one of the borzoi whippers in 
who had halted he stood on a knoll in the stubble holding his whip
aloft and again repeated his long drawn cry a tu this call and
the uplifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hare 

 ah he has found one i think said il gin carelessly yes we
must ride up shall we both course it answered nicholas seeing
in erz and uncle s red rug y two rivals he had never yet had
a chance of pitting against his own borzois and suppose they outdo
my m lka at once he thought as he rode with uncle and il gin
toward the hare 

 a full grown one asked il gin as he approached the whip who
had sighted the hare and not without agitation he looked round and
whistled to erz 

 and you michael nikan rovich he said addressing uncle 

the latter was riding with a sullen expression on his face 

 how can i join in why you ve given a village for each of your
borzois that s it come on yours are worth thousands try yours
against one another you two and i ll look on 

 rug y hey hey he shouted rug yushka he added 
involuntarily by this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes
he placed on this red borzoi nat sha saw and felt the agitation the
two elderly men and her brother were trying to conceal and was herself
excited by it 

the huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and the
gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace the hounds that were far off
on the horizon turned away from the hare and the whips but not the
gentlefolk also moved away all were moving slowly and sedately 

 how is it pointing asked nicholas riding a hundred paces toward
the whip who had sighted the hare 

but before the whip could reply the hare scenting the frost coming
next morning was unable to rest and leaped up the pack on leash rushed
downhill in full cry after the hare and from all sides the borzois that
were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare all the hunt 
who had been moving slowly shouted stop calling in the hounds 
while the borzoi whips with a cry of a tu galloped across the
field setting the borzois on the hare the tranquil il gin nicholas 
nat sha and uncle flew reckless of where and how they went 
seeing only the borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose sight even
for an instant of the chase the hare they had started was a strong and
swift one when he jumped up he did not run at once but pricked his
ears listening to the shouting and trampling that resounded from all
sides at once he took a dozen bounds not very quickly letting the
borzois gain on him and finally having chosen his direction and
realized his danger laid back his ears and rushed off headlong he had
been lying in the stubble but in front of him was the autumn sowing
where the ground was soft the two borzois of the huntsman who had
sighted him having been the nearest were the first to see and pursue
him but they had not gone far before il gin s red spotted erz 
passed them got within a length flew at the hare with terrible
swiftness aiming at his scut and thinking she had seized him rolled
over like a ball the hare arched his back and bounded off yet more
swiftly from behind erz rushed the broad haunched black spotted
m lka and began rapidly gaining on the hare 

 mil shka dear rose nicholas triumphant cry it looked as if
m lka would immediately pounce on the hare but she overtook him and
flew past the hare had squatted again the beautiful erz reached him 
but when close to the hare s scut paused as if measuring the distance 
so as not to make a mistake this time but seize his hind leg 

 erz darling il gin wailed in a voice unlike his own erz 
did not hearken to his appeal at the very moment when she would have
seized her prey the hare moved and darted along the balk between the
winter rye and the stubble again erz and m lka were abreast running
like a pair of carriage horses and began to overtake the hare but
it was easier for the hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not
overtake him so quickly 

 rug y rug yushka that s it come on came a third voice just
then and uncle s red borzoi straining and curving its back 
caught up with the two foremost borzois pushed ahead of them regardless
of the terrible strain put on speed close to the hare knocked it off
the balk onto the ryefield again put on speed still more viciously 
sinking to his knees in the muddy field and all one could see was
how muddying his back he rolled over with the hare a ring of borzois
surrounded him a moment later everyone had drawn up round the crowd
of dogs only the delighted uncle dismounted and cut off a pad 
shaking the hare for the blood to drip off and anxiously glancing round
with restless eyes while his arms and legs twitched he spoke without
himself knowing whom to or what about that s it come on that s
a dog there it has beaten them all the thousand ruble as well as
the one ruble borzois that s it come on said he panting and
looking wrathfully around as if he were abusing someone as if they
were all his enemies and had insulted him and only now had he at
last succeeded in justifying himself there are your thousand ruble
ones that s it come on 

 rug y here s a pad for you he said throwing down the
hare s muddy pad you ve deserved it that s it come on 

 she d tired herself out she d run it down three times by
herself said nicholas also not listening to anyone and regardless
of whether he were heard or not 

 but what is there in running across it like that said il gin s
groom 

 once she had missed it and turned it away any mongrel could take
it il gin was saying at the same time breathless from his gallop
and his excitement at the same moment nat sha without drawing
breath screamed joyously ecstatically and so piercingly that it set
everyone s ear tingling by that shriek she expressed what the others
expressed by all talking at once and it was so strange that she must
herself have been ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone else would have
been amazed at it at any other time uncle himself twisted up the
hare threw it neatly and smartly across his horse s back as if by
that gesture he meant to rebuke everybody and with an air of not
wishing to speak to anyone mounted his bay and rode off the others all
followed dispirited and shamefaced and only much later were they able
to regain their former affectation of indifference for a long time they
continued to look at red rug y who his arched back spattered with
mud and clanking the ring of his leash walked along just behind
 uncle s horse with the serene air of a conqueror 

 well i am like any other dog as long as it s not a question of
coursing but when it is then look out his appearance seemed to
nicholas to be saying 

when much later uncle rode up to nicholas and began talking
to him he felt flattered that after what had happened uncle 
deigned to speak to him 





chapter vii

toward evening il gin took leave of nicholas who found that they were
so far from home that he accepted uncle s offer that the hunting
party should spend the night in his little village of mikh ylovna 

 and if you put up at my house that will be better still that s it 
come on said uncle you see it s damp weather and you
could rest and the little countess could be driven home in a trap 

 uncle s offer was accepted a huntsman was sent to otr dnoe for
a trap while nicholas rode with nat sha and p tya to uncle s 
house 

some five male domestic serfs big and little rushed out to the front
porch to meet their master a score of women serfs old and young as
well as children popped out from the back entrance to have a look at
the hunters who were arriving the presence of nat sha a woman a
lady and on horseback raised the curiosity of the serfs to such a
degree that many of them came up to her stared her in the face and
unabashed by her presence made remarks about her as though she were some
prodigy on show and not a human being able to hear or understand what
was said about her 

 ar nka look she sits sideways there she sits and her skirt
dangles see she s got a little hunting horn 

 goodness gracious see her knife 

 isn t she a tartar 

 how is it you didn t go head over heels asked the boldest of
all addressing nat sha directly 

 uncle dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which
stood in the midst of an overgrown garden and after a glance at his
retainers shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should take
themselves off and that all necessary preparations should be made to
receive the guests and the visitors 

the serfs all dispersed uncle lifted nat sha off her horse and
taking her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch the
house with its bare unplastered log walls was not overclean it
did not seem that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotless but
neither was it noticeably neglected in the entry there was a smell of
fresh apples and wolf and fox skins hung about 

 uncle led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with
a folding table and red chairs then into the drawing room with a round
birchwood table and a sofa and finally into his private room where
there was a tattered sofa a worn carpet and portraits of suv rov of
the host s father and mother and of himself in military uniform the
study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs uncle asked his visitors
to sit down and make themselves at home and then went out of the room 
rug y his back still muddy came into the room and lay down on the
sofa cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth leading from the study
was a passage in which a partition with ragged curtains could be
seen from behind this came women s laughter and whispers nat sha 
nicholas and p tya took off their wraps and sat down on the sofa 
p tya leaning on his elbow fell asleep at once nat sha and nicholas
were silent their faces glowed they were hungry and very cheerful 
they looked at one another now that the hunt was over and they were in
the house nicholas no longer considered it necessary to show his manly
superiority over his sister nat sha gave him a wink and neither
refrained long from bursting into a peal of ringing laughter even before
they had a pretext ready to account for it 

after a while uncle came in in a cossack coat blue trousers and
small top boots and nat sha felt that this costume the very one she
had regarded with surprise and amusement at otr dnoe was just the
right thing and not at all worse than a swallow tail or frock coat 
 uncle too was in high spirits and far from being offended by the
brother s and sister s laughter it could never enter his head that
they might be laughing at his way of life he himself joined in the
merriment 

 that s right young countess that s it come on i never saw
anyone like her said he offering nicholas a pipe with a long stem
and with a practiced motion of three fingers taking down another that
had been cut short she s ridden all day like a man and is as
fresh as ever 

soon after uncle s reappearance the door was opened evidently
from the sound by a barefooted girl and a stout rosy good looking
woman of about forty with a double chin and full red lips entered
carrying a large loaded tray with hospitable dignity and cordiality in
her glance and in every motion she looked at the visitors and with
a pleasant smile bowed respectfully in spite of her exceptional
stoutness which caused her to protrude her chest and stomach and throw
back her head this woman who was uncle s housekeeper trod
very lightly she went to the table set down the tray and with her
plump white hands deftly took from it the bottles and various hors
d oeuvres and dishes and arranged them on the table when she had
finished she stepped aside and stopped at the door with a smile on her
face here i am i am she now do you understand uncle her
expression said to rost v how could one help understanding not only
nicholas but even nat sha understood the meaning of his puckered brow
and the happy complacent smile that slightly puckered his lips when
an sya f dorovna entered on the tray was a bottle of herb wine 
different kinds of vodka pickled mushrooms rye cakes made with
buttermilk honey in the comb still mead and sparkling mead apples 
nuts raw and roasted and nut and honey sweets afterwards she brought
a freshly roasted chicken ham preserves made with honey and preserves
made with sugar 

all this was the fruit of an sya f dorovna s housekeeping gathered
and prepared by her the smell and taste of it all had a smack
of an sya f dorovna herself a savor of juiciness cleanliness 
whiteness and pleasant smiles 

 take this little lady countess she kept saying as she offered
nat sha first one thing and then another 

nat sha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten such
buttermilk cakes such aromatic jam such honey and nut sweets or such
a chicken anywhere an sya f dorovna left the room 

after supper over their cherry brandy rost v and uncle talked
of past and future hunts of rug y and il gin s dogs while nat sha
sat upright on the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes she tried
several times to wake p tya that he might eat something but he
only muttered incoherent words without waking up nat sha felt so
lighthearted and happy in these novel surroundings that she only feared
the trap would come for her too soon after a casual pause such as
often occurs when receiving friends for the first time in one s own
house uncle answering a thought that was in his visitors 
minds said 

 this you see is how i am finishing my days death will come 
that s it come on nothing will remain then why harm anyone 

 uncle s face was very significant and even handsome as he said
this involuntarily rost v recalled all the good he had heard about
him from his father and the neighbors throughout the whole province
 uncle had the reputation of being the most honorable and
disinterested of cranks they called him in to decide family disputes 
chose him as executor confided secrets to him elected him to be a
justice and to other posts but he always persistently refused public
appointments passing the autumn and spring in the fields on his bay
gelding sitting at home in winter and lying in his overgrown garden in
summer 

 why don t you enter the service uncle 

 i did once but gave it up i am not fit for it that s it come
on i can t make head or tail of it that s for you i haven t
brains enough now hunting is another matter that s it come on 
open the door there he shouted why have you shut it 

the door at the end of the passage led to the huntsmen s room as they
called the room for the hunt servants 

there was a rapid patter of bare feet and an unseen hand opened the
door into the huntsmen s room from which came the clear sounds of a
balal yka on which someone who was evidently a master of the art was
playing nat sha had been listening to those strains for some time and
now went out into the passage to hear better 

 that s m tka my coachman i have got him a good balal yka 
i m fond of it said uncle 

it was the custom for m tka to play the balal yka in the huntsmen s
room when uncle returned from the chase uncle was fond of
such music 

 how good really very good said nicholas with some unintentional
superciliousness as if ashamed to confess that the sounds pleased him
very much 

 very good said nat sha reproachfully noticing her brother s
tone not very good it s simply delicious 

just as uncle s pickled mushrooms honey and cherry brandy had
seemed to her the best in the world so also that song at that moment 
seemed to her the acme of musical delight 

 more please more cried nat sha at the door as soon as the
balal yka ceased m tka tuned up afresh and recommenced thrumming
the balal yka to the air of my lady with trills and variations 
 uncle sat listening slightly smiling with his head on one side 
the air was repeated a hundred times the balal yka was retuned several
times and the same notes were thrummed again but the listeners did
not grow weary of it and wished to hear it again and again an sya
f dorovna came in and leaned her portly person against the doorpost 

 you like listening she said to nat sha with a smile extremely
like uncle s that s a good player of ours she added 

 he doesn t play that part right said uncle suddenly with
an energetic gesture here he ought to burst out that s it come
on ought to burst out 

 do you play then asked nat sha 

 uncle did not answer but smiled 

 an sya go and see if the strings of my guitar are all right i
haven t touched it for a long time that s it come on i ve
given it up 

an sya f dorovna with her light step willingly went to fulfill her
errand and brought back the guitar 

without looking at anyone uncle blew the dust off it and tapping
the case with his bony fingers tuned the guitar and settled himself in
his armchair he took the guitar a little above the fingerboard arching
his left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture and with a wink at
an sya f dorovna struck a single chord pure and sonorous and then
quietly smoothly and confidently began playing in very slow time not
my lady but the well known song came a maiden down the street the
tune played with precision and in exact time began to thrill in the
hearts of nicholas and nat sha arousing in them the same kind of
sober mirth as radiated from an sya f dorovna s whole being an sya
f dorovna flushed and drawing her kerchief over her face went laughing
out of the room uncle continued to play correctly carefully 
with energetic firmness looking with a changed and inspired expression
at the spot where an sya f dorovna had just stood something seemed to
be laughing a little on one side of his face under his gray mustaches 
especially as the song grew brisker and the time quicker and when here
and there as he ran his fingers over the strings something seemed to
snap 

 lovely lovely go on uncle go on shouted nat sha as soon as
he had finished she jumped up and hugged and kissed him nicholas 
nicholas she said turning to her brother as if asking him what
is it moves me so 

nicholas too was greatly pleased by uncle s playing and
 uncle played the piece over again an sya f dorovna s smiling
face reappeared in the doorway and behind hers other faces 

 fetching water clear and sweet 
 stop dear maiden i entreat 

played uncle once more running his fingers skillfully over the
strings and then he stopped short and jerked his shoulders 

 go on uncle dear nat sha wailed in an imploring tone as if her
life depended on it 

 uncle rose and it was as if there were two men in him one of
them smiled seriously at the merry fellow while the merry fellow struck
a na ve and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dance 

 now then niece he exclaimed waving to nat sha the hand that
had just struck a chord 

nat sha threw off the shawl from her shoulders ran forward to face
 uncle and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with her
shoulders and struck an attitude 

where how and when had this young countess educated by an migr e
french governess imbibed from the russian air she breathed that spirit
and obtained that manner which the pas de ch le would one would have
supposed long ago have effaced but the spirit and the movements were
those inimitable and unteachable russian ones that uncle had
expected of her as soon as she had struck her pose and smiled
triumphantly proudly and with sly merriment the fear that had at
first seized nicholas and the others that she might not do the right
thing was at an end and they were already admiring her 

 the french shawl dance 

she did the right thing with such precision such complete precision 
that an sya f dorovna who had at once handed her the handkerchief she
needed for the dance had tears in her eyes though she laughed as she
watched this slim graceful countess reared in silks and velvets and so
different from herself who yet was able to understand all that was
in an sya and in an sya s father and mother and aunt and in every
russian man and woman 

 well little countess that s it come on cried uncle 
with a joyous laugh having finished the dance well done niece now
a fine young fellow must be found as husband for you that s it come
on 

 he s chosen already said nicholas smiling 

 oh said uncle in surprise looking inquiringly at nat sha 
who nodded her head with a happy smile 

 and such a one she said but as soon as she had said it a new
train of thoughts and feelings arose in her what did nicholas 
smile mean when he said chosen already is he glad of it or not 
it is as if he thought my bolk nski would not approve of or understand
our gaiety but he would understand it all where is he now she
thought and her face suddenly became serious but this lasted only a
second don t dare to think about it she said to herself 
and sat down again smilingly beside uncle begging him to play
something more 

 uncle played another song and a valse then after a pause he
cleared his throat and sang his favorite hunting song 

 as twas growing dark last night
 fell the snow so soft and light 

 uncle sang as peasants sing with full and na ve conviction that
the whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune comes
of itself and that apart from the words there is no tune which exists
only to give measure to the words as a result of this the unconsidered
tune like the song of a bird was extraordinarily good nat sha was in
ecstasies over uncle s singing she resolved to give up learning
the harp and to play only the guitar she asked uncle for his
guitar and at once found the chords of the song 

after nine o clock two traps and three mounted men who had been sent
to look for them arrived to fetch nat sha and p tya the count and
countess did not know where they were and were very anxious said one of
the men 

p tya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two
traps nat sha and nicholas got into the other uncle wrapped
nat sha up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness he
accompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be crossed 
so that they had to go round by the ford and he sent huntsmen to ride
in front with lanterns 

 good by dear niece his voice called out of the darkness not
the voice nat sha had known previously but the one that had sung as
 twas growing dark last night 

in the village through which they passed there were red lights and a
cheerful smell of smoke 

 what a darling uncle is said nat sha when they had come out
onto the highroad 

 yes returned nicholas you re not cold 

 no i m quite quite all right i feel so comfortable answered
nat sha almost perplexed by her feelings they remained silent a long
while the night was dark and damp they could not see the horses but
only heard them splashing through the unseen mud 

what was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly caught
and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life how did they all
find place in her but she was very happy as they were nearing home she
suddenly struck up the air of as twas growing dark last night the
tune of which she had all the way been trying to get and had at last
caught 

 got it said nicholas 

 what were you thinking about just now nicholas inquired
nat sha 

they were fond of asking one another that question 

 i said nicholas trying to remember well you see first i
thought that rug y the red hound was like uncle and that if he were
a man he would always keep uncle near him if not for his riding then
for his manner what a good fellow uncle is don t you think so 
well and you 

 i wait a bit wait yes first i thought that we are driving
along and imagining that we are going home but that heaven knows
where we are really going in the darkness and that we shall arrive and
suddenly find that we are not in otr dnoe but in fairyland and then i
thought no nothing else 

 i know i expect you thought of him said nicholas smiling as
nat sha knew by the sound of his voice 

 no said nat sha though she had in reality been thinking about
prince andrew at the same time as of the rest and of how he would
have liked uncle and then i was saying to myself all the way 
 how well an sya carried herself how well and nicholas heard
her spontaneous happy ringing laughter and do you know she
suddenly said i know that i shall never again be as happy and
tranquil as i am now 

 rubbish nonsense humbug exclaimed nicholas and he thought 
 how charming this nat sha of mine is i have no other friend like
her and never shall have why should she marry we might always drive
about together 

 what a darling this nicholas of mine is thought nat sha 

 ah there are still lights in the drawing room she said pointing
to the windows of the house that gleamed invitingly in the moist velvety
darkness of the night 





chapter viii

count ily rost v had resigned the position of marshal of the nobility
because it involved him in too much expense but still his affairs
did not improve nat sha and nicholas often noticed their parents
conferring together anxiously and privately and heard suggestions of
selling the fine ancestral rost v house and estate near moscow it was
not necessary to entertain so freely as when the count had been marshal 
and life at otr dnoe was quieter than in former years but still the
enormous house and its lodges were full of people and more than twenty
sat down to table every day these were all their own people who had
settled down in the house almost as members of the family or persons
who were it seemed obliged to live in the count s house such were
dimmler the musician and his wife vogel the dancing master and his
family bel va an old maiden lady an inmate of the house and many
others such as p tya s tutors the girls former governess and
other people who simply found it preferable and more advantageous to
live in the count s house than at home they had not as many visitors
as before but the old habits of life without which the count and
countess could not conceive of existence remained unchanged there was
still the hunting establishment which nicholas had even enlarged the
same fifty horses and fifteen grooms in the stables the same expensive
presents and dinner parties to the whole district on name days there
were still the count s games of whist and boston at which spreading
out his cards so that everybody could see them he let himself be
plundered of hundreds of rubles every day by his neighbors who looked
upon an opportunity to play a rubber with count rost v as a most
profitable source of income 

the count moved in his affairs as in a huge net trying not to believe
that he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every step and
feeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work carefully and
patiently to disentangle them the countess with her loving heart felt
that her children were being ruined that it was not the count s fault
for he could not help being what he was that though he tried to
hide it he himself suffered from the consciousness of his own and
his children s ruin and she tried to find means of remedying the
position from her feminine point of view she could see only one
solution namely for nicholas to marry a rich heiress she felt this to
be their last hope and that if nicholas refused the match she had found
for him she would have to abandon the hope of ever getting matters
right this match was with julie kar gina the daughter of excellent
and virtuous parents a girl the rost vs had known from childhood and
who had now become a wealthy heiress through the death of the last of
her brothers 

the countess had written direct to julie s mother in moscow suggesting
a marriage between their children and had received a favorable answer
from her kar gina had replied that for her part she was agreeable and
everything depend on her daughter s inclination she invited nicholas
to come to moscow 

several times the countess with tears in her eyes told her son that
now both her daughters were settled her only wish was to see him
married she said she could lie down in her grave peacefully if that
were accomplished then she told him that she knew of a splendid girl
and tried to discover what he thought about marriage 

at other times she praised julie to him and advised him to go to
moscow during the holidays to amuse himself nicholas guessed what his
mother s remarks were leading to and during one of these conversations
induced her to speak quite frankly she told him that her only hope
of getting their affairs disentangled now lay in his marrying julie
kar gina 

 but mamma suppose i loved a girl who has no fortune would
you expect me to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for the sake of
money he asked his mother not realizing the cruelty of his question
and only wishing to show his noble mindedness 

 no you have not understood me said his mother not knowing how
to justify herself you have not understood me nik lenka it is
your happiness i wish for she added feeling that she was telling an
untruth and was becoming entangled she began to cry 

 mamma don t cry only tell me that you wish it and you know i
will give my life anything to put you at ease said nicholas i
would sacrifice anything for you even my feelings 

but the countess did not want the question put like that she did not
want a sacrifice from her son she herself wished to make a sacrifice
for him 

 no you have not understood me don t let us talk about it she
replied wiping away her tears 

 maybe i do love a poor girl said nicholas to himself am i to
sacrifice my feelings and my honor for money i wonder how mamma could
speak so to me because s nya is poor i must not love her he
thought must not respond to her faithful devoted love yet i should
certainly be happier with her than with some doll like julie i can
always sacrifice my feelings for my family s welfare he said to
himself but i can t coerce my feelings if i love s nya that
feeling is for me stronger and higher than all else 

nicholas did not go to moscow and the countess did not renew the
conversation with him about marriage she saw with sorrow and sometimes
with exasperation symptoms of a growing attachment between her son and
the portionless s nya though she blamed herself for it she could
not refrain from grumbling at and worrying s nya often pulling her up
without reason addressing her stiffly as my dear and using the
formal you instead of the intimate thou in speaking to her 
the kindhearted countess was the more vexed with s nya because that
poor dark eyed niece of hers was so meek so kind so devotedly
grateful to her benefactors and so faithfully unchangingly and
unselfishly in love with nicholas that there were no grounds for
finding fault with her 

nicholas was spending the last of his leave at home a fourth letter had
come from prince andrew from rome in which he wrote that he would have
been on his way back to russia long ago had not his wound unexpectedly
reopened in the warm climate which obliged him to defer his return till
the beginning of the new year nat sha was still as much in love with
her betrothed found the same comfort in that love and was still as
ready to throw herself into all the pleasures of life as before but at
the end of the fourth month of their separation she began to have fits
of depression which she could not master she felt sorry for herself 
sorry that she was being wasted all this time and of no use to
anyone while she felt herself so capable of loving and being loved 

things were not cheerful in the rost vs home 





chapter ix

christmas came and except for the ceremonial mass the solemn and
wearisome christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants and the
new dresses everyone put on there were no special festivities though
the calm frost of twenty degrees r aumur the dazzling sunshine by day 
and the starlight of the winter nights seemed to call for some special
celebration of the season 

on the third day of christmas week after the midday dinner all the
inmates of the house dispersed to various rooms it was the dullest time
of the day nicholas who had been visiting some neighbors that morning 
was asleep on the sitting room sofa the old count was resting in his
study s nya sat in the drawing room at the round table copying a
design for embroidery the countess was playing patience nast sya
iv novna the buffoon sat with a sad face at the window with two old
ladies nat sha came into the room went up to s nya glanced at
what she was doing and then went up to her mother and stood without
speaking 

 why are you wandering about like an outcast asked her mother 
 what do you want 

 him i want him now this minute i want him said nat sha 
with glittering eyes and no sign of a smile 

the countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter 

 don t look at me mamma don t look i shall cry directly 

 sit down with me a little said the countess 

 mamma i want him why should i be wasted like this mamma 

her voice broke tears gushed from her eyes and she turned quickly to
hide them and left the room 

she passed into the sitting room stood there thinking awhile and then
went into the maids room there an old maidservant was grumbling at
a young girl who stood panting having just run in through the cold from
the serfs quarters 

 stop playing there s a time for everything said the old
woman 

 let her alone kondr tevna said nat sha go mavr shka 
go 

having released mavr shka nat sha crossed the dancing hall and went
to the vestibule there an old footman and two young ones were playing
cards they broke off and rose as she entered 

 what can i do with them thought nat sha 

 oh nik ta please go where can i send him yes go to the
yard and fetch a fowl please a cock and you misha bring me some
oats 

 just a few oats said misha cheerfully and readily 

 go go quickly the old man urged him 

 and you theodore get me a piece of chalk 

on her way past the butler s pantry she told them to set a samovar 
though it was not at all the time for tea 

f ka the butler was the most ill tempered person in the house 
nat sha liked to test her power over him he distrusted the order and
asked whether the samovar was really wanted 

 oh dear what a young lady said f ka pretending to frown at
nat sha 

no one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble as
nat sha did she could not see people unconcernedly but had to send
them on some errand she seemed to be trying whether any of them would
get angry or sulky with her but the serfs fulfilled no one s orders
so readily as they did hers what can i do where can i go 
thought she as she went slowly along the passage 

 nast sya iv novna what sort of children shall i have she asked
the buffoon who was coming toward her in a woman s jacket 

 why fleas crickets grasshoppers answered the buffoon 

 o lord o lord it s always the same oh where am i to go what
am i to do with myself and tapping with her heels she ran quickly
upstairs to see vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story 

two governesses were sitting with the vogels at a table on which were
plates of raisins walnuts and almonds the governesses were discussing
whether it was cheaper to live in moscow or odessa nat sha sat down 
listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air and then got
up again 

 the island of madagascar she said ma da gas car she
repeated articulating each syllable distinctly and not replying to
madame schoss who asked her what she was saying she went out of the
room 

her brother p tya was upstairs too with the man in attendance on him
he was preparing fireworks to let off that night 

 p tya p tya she called to him carry me downstairs 

p tya ran up and offered her his back she jumped on it putting her
arms round his neck and he pranced along with her 

 no don t the island of madagascar she said and jumping off
his back she went downstairs 

having as it were reviewed her kingdom tested her power and made
sure that everyone was submissive but that all the same it was dull 
nat sha betook herself to the ballroom picked up her guitar sat down
in a dark corner behind a bookcase and began to run her fingers over
the strings in the bass picking out a passage she recalled from an
opera she had heard in petersburg with prince andrew what she drew from
the guitar would have had no meaning for other listeners but in her
imagination a whole series of reminiscences arose from those sounds 
she sat behind the bookcase with her eyes fixed on a streak of light
escaping from the pantry door and listened to herself and pondered she
was in a mood for brooding on the past 

s nya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand nat sha glanced
at her and at the crack in the pantry door and it seemed to her that
she remembered the light falling through that crack once before and
s nya passing with a glass in her hand yes it was exactly the
same thought nat sha 

 s nya what is this she cried twanging a thick string 

 oh you are there said s nya with a start and came near and
listened i don t know a storm she ventured timidly afraid of
being wrong 

 there that s just how she started and just how she came up smiling
timidly when all this happened before thought nat sha and in
just the same way i thought there was something lacking in her 

 no it s the chorus from the water carrier listen and nat sha
sang the air of the chorus so that s nya should catch it where were
you going she asked 

 to change the water in this glass i am just finishing the design 

 you always find something to do but i can t said nat sha 
 and where s nicholas 

 asleep i think 

 s nya go and wake him said nat sha tell him i want him to
come and sing 

she sat awhile wondering what the meaning of it all having happened
before could be and without solving this problem or at all regretting
not having done so she again passed in fancy to the time when she was
with him and he was looking at her with a lover s eyes 

 oh if only he would come quicker i am so afraid it will never be 
and worst of all i am growing old that s the thing there won t
then be in me what there is now but perhaps he ll come today will
come immediately perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing
room perhaps he came yesterday and i have forgotten it she rose 
put down the guitar and went to the drawing room 

all the domestic circle tutors governesses and guests were already
at the tea table the servants stood round the table but prince andrew
was not there and life was going on as before 

 ah here she is said the old count when he saw nat sha enter 
 well sit down by me but nat sha stayed by her mother and
glanced round as if looking for something 

 mamma she muttered give him to me give him mamma quickly 
quickly and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs 

she sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between the
elders and nicholas who had also come to the table my god my god 
the same faces the same talk papa holding his cup and blowing in the
same way thought nat sha feeling with horror a sense of repulsion
rising up in her for the whole household because they were always the
same 

after tea nicholas s nya and nat sha went to the sitting room to
their favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began 





chapter x

 does it ever happen to you said nat sha to her brother when
they settled down in the sitting room does it ever happen to you to
feel as if there were nothing more to come nothing that everything
good is past and to feel not exactly dull but sad 

 i should think so he replied i have felt like that when
everything was all right and everyone was cheerful the thought has come
into my mind that i was already tired of it all and that we must all
die once in the regiment i had not gone to some merrymaking where there
was music and suddenly i felt so depressed 

 oh yes i know i know i know nat sha interrupted him when
i was quite little that used to be so with me do you remember when
i was punished once about some plums you were all dancing and i sat
sobbing in the schoolroom i shall never forget it i felt sad and sorry
for everyone for myself and for everyone and i was innocent that
was the chief thing said nat sha do you remember 

 i remember answered nicholas i remember that i came to you
afterwards and wanted to comfort you but do you know i felt ashamed
to we were terribly absurd i had a funny doll then and wanted to give
it to you do you remember 

 and do you remember nat sha asked with a pensive smile how
once long long ago when we were quite little uncle called us into
the study that was in the old house and it was dark we went in and
suddenly there stood 

 a negro chimed in nicholas with a smile of delight of course
i remember even now i don t know whether there really was a negro or
if we only dreamed it or were told about him 

 he was gray you remember and had white teeth and stood and looked
at us 

 s nya do you remember asked nicholas 

 yes yes i do remember something too s nya answered timidly 

 you know i have asked papa and mamma about that negro said
nat sha and they say there was no negro at all but you see you
remember 

 of course i do i remember his teeth as if i had just seen them 

 how strange it is it s as if it were a dream i like that 

 and do you remember how we rolled hard boiled eggs in the ballroom 
and suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet was that
real or not do you remember what fun it was 

 yes and you remember how papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun in
the porch 

so they went through their memories smiling with pleasure not the sad
memories of old age but poetic youthful ones those impressions of
one s most distant past in which dreams and realities blend and they
laughed with quiet enjoyment 

s nya as always did not quite keep pace with them though they shared
the same reminiscences 

much that they remembered had slipped from her mind and what she
recalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced she
simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it 

she only really took part when they recalled s nya s first arrival 
she told them how afraid she had been of nicholas because he had on a
corded jacket and her nurse had told her that she too would be sewn up
with cords 

 and i remember their telling me that you had been born under a
cabbage said nat sha and i remember that i dared not disbelieve
it then but knew that it was not true and i felt so uncomfortable 

while they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other door of
the sitting room 

 they have brought the cock miss she said in a whisper 

 it isn t wanted p lya tell them to take it away replied
nat sha 

in the middle of their talk in the sitting room dimmler came in and
went up to the harp that stood there in a corner he took off its cloth
covering and the harp gave out a jarring sound 

 mr dimmler please play my favorite nocturne by field came the
old countess voice from the drawing room 

dimmler struck a chord and turning to nat sha nicholas and s nya 
remarked how quiet you young people are 

 yes we re philosophizing said nat sha glancing round for a
moment and then continuing the conversation they were now discussing
dreams 

dimmler began to play nat sha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the table 
took up a candle carried it out and returned seating herself quietly
in her former place it was dark in the room especially where they were
sitting on the sofa but through the big windows the silvery light of
the full moon fell on the floor dimmler had finished the piece but
still sat softly running his fingers over the strings evidently
uncertain whether to stop or to play something else 

 do you know said nat sha in a whisper moving closer to nicholas
and s nya that when one goes on and on recalling memories one at
last begins to remember what happened before one was in the world 

 that is metempsychosis said s nya who had always learned well 
and remembered everything the egyptians believed that our souls have
lived in animals and will go back into animals again 

 no i don t believe we ever were in animals said nat sha 
still in a whisper though the music had ceased but i am certain that
we were angels somewhere there and have been here and that is why we
remember 

 may i join you said dimmler who had come up quietly and he sat
down by them 

 if we have been angels why have we fallen lower said nicholas 
 no that can t be 

 not lower who said we were lower how do i know what i
was before nat sha rejoined with conviction the soul is
immortal well then if i shall always live i must have lived before 
lived for a whole eternity 

 yes but it is hard for us to imagine eternity remarked dimmler 
who had joined the young folk with a mildly condescending smile but now
spoke as quietly and seriously as they 

 why is it hard to imagine eternity said nat sha it is now
today and it will be tomorrow and always and there was yesterday and
the day before 

 nat sha now it s your turn sing me something they heard the
countess say why are you sitting there like conspirators 

 mamma i don t at all want to replied nat sha but all the
same she rose 

none of them not even the middle aged dimmler wanted to break off
their conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room but
nat sha got up and nicholas sat down at the clavichord standing
as usual in the middle of the hall and choosing the place where the
resonance was best nat sha began to sing her mother s favorite song 

she had said she did not want to sing but it was long since she had
sung and long before she again sang as she did that evening the
count from his study where he was talking to m tenka heard her and 
like a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play blundered in his talk
while giving orders to the steward and at last stopped while m tenka
stood in front of him also listening and smiling nicholas did not take
his eyes off his sister and drew breath in time with her s nya as she
listened thought of the immense difference there was between herself
and her friend and how impossible it was for her to be anything like as
bewitching as her cousin the old countess sat with a blissful yet sad
smile and with tears in her eyes occasionally shaking her head she
thought of nat sha and of her own youth and of how there was something
unnatural and dreadful in this impending marriage of nat sha and prince
andrew 

dimmler who had seated himself beside the countess listened with
closed eyes 

 ah countess he said at last that s a european talent she
has nothing to learn what softness tenderness and strength 

 ah how afraid i am for her how afraid i am said the countess 
not realizing to whom she was speaking her maternal instinct told her
that nat sha had too much of something and that because of this
she would not be happy before nat sha had finished singing 
fourteen year old p tya rushed in delightedly to say that some mummers
had arrived 

nat sha stopped abruptly 

 idiot she screamed at her brother and running to a chair threw
herself on it sobbing so violently that she could not stop for a long
time 

 it s nothing mamma really it s nothing only p tya startled
me she said trying to smile but her tears still flowed and sobs
still choked her 

the mummers some of the house serfs dressed up as bears turks 
innkeepers and ladies frightening and funny bringing in with
them the cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety crowded at first
timidly into the anteroom then hiding behind one another they pushed
into the ballroom where shyly at first and then more and more merrily
and heartily they started singing dancing and playing christmas
games the countess when she had identified them and laughed at their
costumes went into the drawing room the count sat in the ballroom 
smiling radiantly and applauding the players the young people had
disappeared 

half an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the
ballroom an old lady in a hooped skirt this was nicholas a turkish
girl was p tya a clown was dimmler an hussar was nat sha and a
circassian was s nya with burnt cork mustache and eyebrows 

after the condescending surprise nonrecognition and praise from those
who were not themselves dressed up the young people decided that their
costumes were so good that they ought to be shown elsewhere 

nicholas who as the roads were in splendid condition wanted to take
them all for a drive in his troyka proposed to take with them about a
dozen of the serf mummers and drive to uncle s 

 no why disturb the old fellow said the countess besides 
you wouldn t have room to turn round there if you must go go to the
melyuk vs 

melyuk va was a widow who with her family and their tutors and
governesses lived three miles from the rost vs 

 that s right my dear chimed in the old count thoroughly
aroused i ll dress up at once and go with them i ll make
pashette open her eyes 

but the countess would not agree to his going he had had a bad leg all
these last days it was decided that the count must not go but that if
louisa iv novna madame schoss would go with them the young ladies
might go to the melyuk vs s nya generally so timid and shy more
urgently than anyone begging louisa iv novna not to refuse 

s nya s costume was the best of all her mustache and eyebrows were
extraordinarily becoming everyone told her she looked very handsome 
and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with her some
inner voice told her that now or never her fate would be decided and
in her male attire she seemed quite a different person louisa iv novna
consented to go and in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and
small bells their runners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow 
drove up to the porch 

nat sha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone which passing
from one to another grew stronger and reached its climax when they all
came out into the frost and got into the sleighs talking calling to
one another laughing and shouting 

two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs the third was the
old count s with a trotter from the orl v stud as shaft horse 
the fourth was nicholas own with a short shaggy black shaft horse 
nicholas in his old lady s dress over which he had belted his hussar
overcoat stood in the middle of the sleigh reins in hand 

it was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal
harness disks and from the eyes of the horses who looked round in alarm
at the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof 

nat sha s nya madame schoss and two maids got into nicholas 
sleigh dimmler his wife and p tya into the old count s and the
rest of the mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs 

 you go ahead zakh r shouted nicholas to his father s
coachman wishing for a chance to race past him 

the old count s troyka with dimmler and his party started forward 
squeaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow its deep toned
bell clanging the side horses pressing against the shafts of the
middle horse sank in the snow which was dry and glittered like sugar 
and threw it up 

nicholas set off following the first sleigh behind him the others
moved noisily their runners squeaking at first they drove at a steady
trot along the narrow road while they drove past the garden the shadows
of the bare trees often fell across the road and hid the brilliant
moonlight but as soon as they were past the fence the snowy plain
bathed in moonlight and motionless spread out before them glittering
like diamonds and dappled with bluish shadows bang bang went the
first sleigh over a cradle hole in the snow of the road and each of
the other sleighs jolted in the same way and rudely breaking the
frost bound stillness the troykas began to speed along the road one
after the other 

 a hare s track a lot of tracks rang out nat sha s voice
through the frost bound air 

 how light it is nicholas came s nya s voice 

nicholas glanced round at s nya and bent down to see her face closer 
quite a new sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped up
at him from her sable furs so close and yet so distant in the
moonlight 

 that used to be s nya thought he and looked at her closer and
smiled 

 what is it nicholas 

 nothing said he and turned again to the horses 

when they came out onto the beaten highroad polished by sleigh runners
and cut up by rough shod hoofs the marks of which were visible in the
moonlight the horses began to tug at the reins of their own accord and
increased their pace the near side horse arching his head and breaking
into a short canter tugged at his traces the shaft horse swayed from
side to side moving his ears as if asking isn t it time to begin
now in front already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing
farther and farther off the black horses driven by zakh r could be
clearly seen against the white snow from that sleigh one could hear the
shouts laughter and voices of the mummers 

 gee up my darlings shouted nicholas pulling the reins to one
side and flourishing the whip 

it was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given by the
side horses who pulled harder ever increasing their gallop that
one noticed how fast the troyka was flying nicholas looked back with
screams squeals and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses
to gallop the other sleighs followed the shaft horse swung steadily
beneath the bow over its head with no thought of slackening pace and
ready to put on speed when required 

nicholas overtook the first sleigh they were driving downhill and
coming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow near a river 

 where are we thought he it s the kos y meadow i suppose 
but no this is something new i ve never seen before this isn t
the kos y meadow nor the d mkin hill and heaven only knows what it
is it is something new and enchanted well whatever it may be 
and shouting to his horses he began to pass the first sleigh 

zakh r held back his horses and turned his face which was already
covered with hoarfrost to his eyebrows 

nicholas gave the horses the rein and zakh r stretching out his arms 
clucked his tongue and let his horses go 

 now look out master he cried 

faster still the two troykas flew side by side and faster moved
the feet of the galloping side horses nicholas began to draw ahead 
zakh r while still keeping his arms extended raised one hand with the
reins 

 no you won t master he shouted 

nicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed zakh r the horses
showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleigh beside
them sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of
swiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing 
the whistling sound of the runners on the snow and the voices of girls
shrieking were heard from different sides 

again checking his horses nicholas looked around him they were still
surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled with
stars 

 zakh r is shouting that i should turn to the left but why to the
left thought nicholas are we getting to the melyuk vs is
this melyuk vka heaven only knows where we are going and heaven knows
what is happening to us but it is very strange and pleasant whatever
it is and he looked round in the sleigh 

 look his mustache and eyelashes are all white said one of the
strange pretty unfamiliar people the one with fine eyebrows and
mustache 

 i think this used to be nat sha thought nicholas and that
was madame schoss but perhaps it s not and this circassian with the
mustache i don t know but i love her 

 aren t you cold he asked 

they did not answer but began to laugh dimmler from the sleigh behind
shouted something probably something funny but they could not make
out what he said 

 yes yes some voices answered laughing 

 but here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows and a glitter
of diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the silver roofs of fairy
buildings and the shrill yells of some animals and if this is really
melyuk vka it is still stranger that we drove heaven knows where and
have come to melyuk vka thought nicholas 

it really was melyuk vka and maids and footmen with merry faces came
running out to the porch carrying candles 

 who is it asked someone in the porch 

 the mummers from the count s i know by the horses replied some
voices 





chapter xi

pelag ya dan lovna melyuk va a broadly built energetic woman
wearing spectacles sat in the drawing room in a loose dress surrounded
by her daughters whom she was trying to keep from feeling dull they
were quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at the shadows
the wax figures would throw on the wall when they heard the steps and
voices of new arrivals in the vestibule 

hussars ladies witches clowns and bears after clearing their
throats and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule 
came into the ballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted the
clown dimmler and the lady nicholas started a dance surrounded
by the screaming children the mummers covering their faces and
disguising their voices bowed to their hostess and arranged themselves
about the room 

 dear me there s no recognizing them and nat sha see whom
she looks like she really reminds me of somebody but herr
dimmler isn t he good i didn t know him and how he dances dear
me there s a circassian really how becoming it is to dear s nya 
and who is that well you have cheered us up nik ta and vanya clear
away the tables and we were sitting so quietly ha ha ha the
hussar the hussar just like a boy and the legs i can t look at
him different voices were saying 

nat sha the young melyuk vs favorite disappeared with them into
the back rooms where a cork and various dressing gowns and male garments
were called for and received from the footman by bare girlish arms from
behind the door ten minutes later all the young melyuk vs joined the
mummers 

pelag ya dan lovna having given orders to clear the rooms for the
visitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs 
went about among the mummers without removing her spectacles peering
into their faces with a suppressed smile and failing to recognize any
of them it was not merely dimmler and the rost vs she failed to
recognize she did not even recognize her own daughters or her late
husband s dressing gowns and uniforms which they had put on 

 and who is this she asked her governess peering into the face of
her own daughter dressed up as a kaz n tartar i suppose it is one
of the rost vs well mr hussar and what regiment do you serve in 
she asked nat sha here hand some fruit jelly to the turk 
she ordered the butler who was handing things round that s not
forbidden by his law 

sometimes as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by the
dancers who having decided once for all that being disguised no one
would recognize them were not at all shy pelag ya dan lovna hid
her face in her handkerchief and her whole stout body shook with
irrepressible kindly elderly laughter 

 my little s sha look at s sha she said 

after russian country dances and chorus dances pelag ya dan lovna
made the serfs and gentry join in one large circle a ring a string 
and a silver ruble were fetched and they all played games together 

in an hour all the costumes were crumpled and disordered the corked
eyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring flushed 
and merry faces pelag ya dan lovna began to recognize the mummers 
admired their cleverly contrived costumes and particularly how they
suited the young ladies and she thanked them all for having entertained
her so well the visitors were invited to supper in the drawing room 
and the serfs had something served to them in the ballroom 

 now to tell one s fortune in the empty bathhouse is frightening 
said an old maid who lived with the melyuk vs during supper 

 why said the eldest melyuk v girl 

 you wouldn t go it takes courage 

 i ll go said s nya 

 tell what happened to the young lady said the second melyuk v
girl 

 well began the old maid a young lady once went out took a
cock laid the table for two all properly and sat down after sitting
a while she suddenly hears someone coming a sleigh drives up with
harness bells she hears him coming he comes in just in the shape of a
man like an officer comes in and sits down to table with her 

 ah ah screamed nat sha rolling her eyes with horror 

 yes and how did he speak 

 yes like a man everything quite all right and he began persuading
her and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow but she got
frightened just got frightened and hid her face in her hands then he
caught her up it was lucky the maids ran in just then 

 now why frighten them said pelag ya dan lovna 

 mamma you used to try your fate yourself said her daughter 

 and how does one do it in a barn inquired s nya 

 well say you went to the barn now and listened it depends on what
you hear hammering and knocking that s bad but a sound of shifting
grain is good and one sometimes hears that too 

 mamma tell us what happened to you in the barn 

pelag ya dan lovna smiled 

 oh i ve forgotten she replied but none of you would
go 

 yes i will pelag ya dan lovna let me i ll go said s nya 

 well why not if you re not afraid 

 louisa iv novna may i asked s nya 

whether they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game or
talking as now nicholas did not leave s nya s side and gazed at her
with quite new eyes it seemed to him that it was only today thanks
to that burnt cork mustache that he had fully learned to know her and
really that evening s nya was brighter more animated and prettier
than nicholas had ever seen her before 

 so that s what she is like what a fool i have been he thought
gazing at her sparkling eyes and under the mustache a happy rapturous
smile dimpled her cheeks a smile he had never seen before 

 i m not afraid of anything said s nya may i go at once 
she got up 

they told her where the barn was and how she should stand and listen 
and they handed her a fur cloak she threw this over her head and
shoulders and glanced at nicholas 

 what a darling that girl is thought he and what have i been
thinking of till now 

s nya went out into the passage to go to the barn nicholas went
hastily to the front porch saying he felt too hot the crowd of people
really had made the house stuffy 

outside there was the same cold stillness and the same moon but even
brighter than before the light was so strong and the snow sparkled with
so many stars that one did not wish to look up at the sky and the real
stars were unnoticed the sky was black and dreary while the earth was
gay 

 i am a fool a fool what have i been waiting for thought
nicholas and running out from the porch he went round the corner of
the house and along the path that led to the back porch he knew s nya
would pass that way halfway lay some snow covered piles of firewood and
across and along them a network of shadows from the bare old lime trees
fell on the snow and on the path this path led to the barn the log
walls of the barn and its snow covered roof that looked as if hewn out
of some precious stone sparkled in the moonlight a tree in the garden
snapped with the frost and then all was again perfectly silent his
bosom seemed to inhale not air but the strength of eternal youth and
gladness 

from the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps the
bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heard
the voice of an old maidservant saying straight straight along the
path miss only don t look back 

 i am not afraid answered s nya s voice and along the path
toward nicholas came the crunching whistling sound of s nya s feet
in her thin shoes 

s nya came along wrapped in her cloak she was only a couple of paces
away when she saw him and to her too he was not the nicholas she had
known and always slightly feared he was in a woman s dress with
tousled hair and a happy smile new to s nya she ran rapidly toward
him 

 quite different and yet the same thought nicholas looking at her
face all lit up by the moonlight he slipped his arms under the cloak
that covered her head embraced her pressed her to him and kissed her
on the lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt cork s nya
kissed him full on the lips and disengaging her little hands pressed
them to his cheeks 

 s nya nicholas was all they said they ran to the barn
and then back again re entering he by the front and she by the back
porch 





chapter xii

when they all drove back from pelag ya dan lovna s nat sha who
always saw and noticed everything arranged that she and madame schoss
should go back in the sleigh with dimmler and s nya with nicholas and
the maids 

on the way back nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing and
kept peering by that fantastic all transforming light into s nya s
face and searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former and
his present s nya from whom he had resolved never to be parted again 
he looked and recognizing in her both the old and the new s nya and
being reminded by the smell of burnt cork of the sensation of her kiss 
inhaled the frosty air with a full breast and looking at the ground
flying beneath him and at the sparkling sky felt himself again in
fairyland 

 s nya is it well with thee he asked from time to time 

 yes she replied and with thee 

when halfway home nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and ran for
a moment to nat sha s sleigh and stood on its wing 

 nat sha he whispered in french do you know i have made up my
mind about s nya 

 have you told her asked nat sha suddenly beaming all over with
joy 

 oh how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows 
nat sha are you glad 

 i am so glad so glad i was beginning to be vexed with you i did
not tell you but you have been treating her badly what a heart she
has nicholas i am horrid sometimes but i was ashamed to be happy
while s nya was not continued nat sha now i am so glad well 
run back to her 

 no wait a bit oh how funny you look cried nicholas peering
into her face and finding in his sister too something new unusual and
bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before nat sha 
it s magical isn t it 

 yes she replied you have done splendidly 

 had i seen her before as she is now thought nicholas i should
long ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me 
and all would have been well 

 so you are glad and i have done right 

 oh quite right i had a quarrel with mamma some time ago about it 
mamma said she was angling for you how could she say such a thing i
nearly stormed at mamma i will never let anyone say anything bad of
s nya for there is nothing but good in her 

 then it s all right said nicholas again scrutinizing the
expression of his sister s face to see if she was in earnest then he
jumped down and his boots scrunching the snow ran back to his sleigh 
the same happy smiling circassian with mustache and beaming eyes
looking up from under a sable hood was still sitting there and that
circassian was s nya and that s nya was certainly his future happy
and loving wife 

when they reached home and had told their mother how they had spent the
evening at the melyuk vs the girls went to their bedroom when they
had undressed but without washing off the cork mustaches they sat a
long time talking of their happiness they talked of how they would live
when they were married how their husbands would be friends and how
happy they would be on nat sha s table stood two looking glasses
which duny sha had prepared beforehand 

 only when will all that be i am afraid never it would be too
good said nat sha rising and going to the looking glasses 

 sit down nat sha perhaps you ll see him said s nya 

nat sha lit the candles one on each side of one of the looking
glasses and sat down 

 i see someone with a mustache said nat sha seeing her own face 

 you mustn t laugh miss said duny sha 

with s nya s help and the maid s nat sha got the glass she held
into the right position opposite the other her face assumed a serious
expression and she sat silent she sat a long time looking at the
receding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting from
tales she had heard to see a coffin or him prince andrew in that
last dim indistinctly outlined square but ready as she was to take the
smallest speck for the image of a man or of a coffin she saw nothing 
she began blinking rapidly and moved away from the looking glasses 

 why is it others see things and i don t she said you sit
down now s nya you absolutely must tonight do it for me today i
feel so frightened 

s nya sat down before the glasses got the right position and began
looking 

 now miss s nya is sure to see something whispered duny sha 
 while you do nothing but laugh 

s nya heard this and nat sha s whisper 

 i know she will she saw something last year 

for about three minutes all were silent 

 of course she will whispered nat sha but did not finish 
suddenly s nya pushed away the glass she was holding and covered her
eyes with her hand 

 oh nat sha she cried 

 did you see did you what was it exclaimed nat sha holding up
the looking glass 

s nya had not seen anything she was just wanting to blink and to get
up when she heard nat sha say of course she will she did not
wish to disappoint either duny sha or nat sha but it was hard to sit
still she did not herself know how or why the exclamation escaped her
when she covered her eyes 

 you saw him urged nat sha seizing her hand 

 yes wait a bit i saw him s nya could not help saying not
yet knowing whom nat sha meant by him nicholas or prince andrew 

 but why shouldn t i say i saw something others do see besides who
can tell whether i saw anything or not flashed through s nya s
mind 

 yes i saw him she said 

 how standing or lying 

 no i saw at first there was nothing then i saw him lying
down 

 andrew lying is he ill asked nat sha her frightened eyes fixed
on her friend 

 no on the contrary on the contrary his face was cheerful and he
turned to me and when saying this she herself fancied she had really
seen what she described 

 well and then s nya 

 after that i could not make out what there was something blue and
red 

 s nya when will he come back when shall i see him o god how
afraid i am for him and for myself and about everything nat sha
began and without replying to s nya s words of comfort she got into
bed and long after her candle was out lay open eyed and motionless 
gazing at the moonlight through the frosty windowpanes 





chapter xiii

soon after the christmas holidays nicholas told his mother of his love
for s nya and of his firm resolve to marry her the countess who
had long noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this
declaration listened to him in silence and then told her son that he
might marry whom he pleased but that neither she nor his father would
give their blessing to such a marriage nicholas for the first time 
felt that his mother was displeased with him and that despite her love
for him she would not give way coldly without looking at her son 
she sent for her husband and when he came tried briefly and coldly to
inform him of the facts in her son s presence but unable to restrain
herself she burst into tears of vexation and left the room the old
count began irresolutely to admonish nicholas and beg him to abandon his
purpose nicholas replied that he could not go back on his word and his
father sighing and evidently disconcerted very soon became silent and
went in to the countess in all his encounters with his son the count
was always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the
family fortune and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to
marry an heiress and choosing the dowerless s nya on this occasion he
was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had not
been in disorder no better wife for nicholas than s nya could have
been wished for and that no one but himself with his m tenka and
his uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the family
finances 

the father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again 
but a few days later the countess sent for s nya and with a cruelty
neither of them expected reproached her niece for trying to catch
nicholas and for ingratitude s nya listened silently with downcast
eyes to the countess cruel words without understanding what
was required of her she was ready to sacrifice everything for her
benefactors self sacrifice was her most cherished idea but in this case
she could not see what she ought to sacrifice or for whom she could
not help loving the countess and the whole rost v family but neither
could she help loving nicholas and knowing that his happiness depended
on that love she was silent and sad and did not reply nicholas felt
the situation to be intolerable and went to have an explanation with his
mother he first implored her to forgive him and s nya and consent to
their marriage then he threatened that if she molested s nya he would
at once marry her secretly 

the countess with a coldness her son had never seen in her before 
replied that he was of age that prince andrew was marrying without his
father s consent and he could do the same but that she would never
receive that intriguer as her daughter 

exploding at the word intriguer nicholas raising his voice told
his mother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his
feelings but if that were so he would say for the last time but he
had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression of his face
caused his mother to await with terror and which would perhaps have
forever remained a cruel memory to them both he had not time to say it 
for nat sha with a pale and set face entered the room from the door
at which she had been listening 

 nicholas you are talking nonsense be quiet be quiet be quiet i
tell you she almost screamed so as to drown his voice 

 mamma darling it s not at all so my poor sweet darling she
said to her mother who conscious that they had been on the brink of
a rupture gazed at her son with terror but in the obstinacy and
excitement of the conflict could not and would not give way 

 nicholas i ll explain to you go away listen mamma darling 
said nat sha 

her words were incoherent but they attained the purpose at which she
was aiming 

the countess sobbing heavily hid her face on her daughter s breast 
while nicholas rose clutching his head and left the room 

nat sha set to work to effect a reconciliation and so far succeeded
that nicholas received a promise from his mother that s nya should not
be troubled while he on his side promised not to undertake anything
without his parents knowledge 

firmly resolved after putting his affairs in order in the regiment 
to retire from the army and return and marry s nya nicholas serious 
sorrowful and at variance with his parents but as it seemed to him 
passionately in love left at the beginning of january to rejoin his
regiment 

after nicholas had gone things in the rost v household were more
depressing than ever and the countess fell ill from mental agitation 

s nya was unhappy at the separation from nicholas and still more so on
account of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting toward
her the count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of his
affairs which called for some decisive action their town house and
estate near moscow had inevitably to be sold and for this they had to
go to moscow but the countess health obliged them to delay their
departure from day to day 

nat sha who had borne the first period of separation from her
betrothed lightly and even cheerfully now grew more agitated and
impatient every day the thought that her best days which she would
have employed in loving him were being vainly wasted with no advantage
to anyone tormented her incessantly his letters for the most part
irritated her it hurt her to think that while she lived only in the
thought of him he was living a real life seeing new places and new
people that interested him the more interesting his letters were
the more vexed she felt her letters to him far from giving her any
comfort seemed to her a wearisome and artificial obligation she could
not write because she could not conceive the possibility of expressing
sincerely in a letter even a thousandth part of what she expressed by
voice smile and glance she wrote to him formal monotonous and dry
letters to which she attached no importance herself and in the rough
copies of which the countess corrected her mistakes in spelling 

there was still no improvement in the countess health but it was
impossible to defer the journey to moscow any longer nat sha s
trousseau had to be ordered and the house sold moreover prince andrew
was expected in moscow where old prince bolk nski was spending the
winter and nat sha felt sure he had already arrived 

so the countess remained in the country and the count taking s nya
and nat sha with him went to moscow at the end of january 





book eight 1811 12





chapter i

after prince andrew s engagement to nat sha pierre without any
apparent cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as before 
firmly convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his
benefactor and happy as he had been in perfecting his inner man to
which he had devoted himself with such ardor all the zest of such a
life vanished after the engagement of andrew and nat sha and the death
of joseph alex evich the news of which reached him almost at the same
time only the skeleton of life remained his house a brilliant wife
who now enjoyed the favors of a very important personage acquaintance
with all petersburg and his court service with its dull formalities 
and this life suddenly seemed to pierre unexpectedly loathsome he
ceased keeping a diary avoided the company of the brothers began going
to the club again drank a great deal and came once more in touch
with the bachelor sets leading such a life that the countess h l ne
thought it necessary to speak severely to him about it pierre felt that
she was right and to avoid compromising her went away to moscow 

in moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded and
fading princesses still lived with its enormous retinue as soon as 
driving through the town he saw the iberian shrine with innumerable
tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons the kr mlin
square with its snow undisturbed by vehicles the sleigh drivers and
hovels of the s vtsev vrazh k those old moscovites who desired
nothing hurried nowhere and were ending their days leisurely when he
saw those old moscow ladies the moscow balls and the english club he
felt himself at home in a quiet haven in moscow he felt at peace at
home warm and dirty as in an old dressing gown 

moscow society from the old women down to the children received pierre
like a long expected guest whose place was always ready awaiting him 
for moscow society pierre was the nicest kindest most intellectual 
merriest and most magnanimous of cranks a heedless genial nobleman of
the old russian type his purse was always empty because it was open to
everyone 

benefit performances poor pictures statues benevolent societies 
gypsy choirs schools subscription dinners sprees freemasons 
churches and books no one and nothing met with a refusal from him 
and had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large sums from
him and taken him under their protection he would have given everything
away there was never a dinner or soiree at the club without him as
soon as he sank into his place on the sofa after two bottles of margaux
he was surrounded and talking disputing and joking began when there
were quarrels his kindly smile and well timed jests reconciled the
antagonists the masonic dinners were dull and dreary when he was not
there 

when after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile 
yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere
with them shouts of delight and triumph arose among the young men 
at balls he danced if a partner was needed young ladies married and
unmarried liked him because without making love to any of them he was
equally amiable to all especially after supper il est charmant il
n a pas de sexe they said of him 

 he is charming he has no sex 


pierre was one of those retired gentlemen in waiting of whom there were
hundreds good humoredly ending their days in moscow 

how horrified he would have been seven years before when he first
arrived from abroad had he been told that there was no need for him
to seek or plan anything that his rut had long been shaped eternally
predetermined and that wriggle as he might he would be what all in
his position were he could not have believed it had he not at one
time longed with all his heart to establish a republic in russia 
then himself to be a napoleon then to be a philosopher and then
a strategist and the conqueror of napoleon had he not seen the
possibility of and passionately desired the regeneration of the sinful
human race and his own progress to the highest degree of perfection 
had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated his serfs 

but instead of all that here he was the wealthy husband of an
unfaithful wife a retired gentleman in waiting fond of eating and
drinking and as he unbuttoned his waistcoat of abusing the government
a bit a member of the moscow english club and a universal favorite in
moscow society for a long time he could not reconcile himself to the
idea that he was one of those same retired moscow gentlemen in waiting
he had so despised seven years before 

sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only living
this life temporarily but then he was shocked by the thought of how
many like himself had entered that life and that club temporarily 
with all their teeth and hair and had only left it when not a single
tooth or hair remained 

in moments of pride when he thought of his position it seemed to
him that he was quite different and distinct from those other retired
gentlemen in waiting he had formerly despised they were empty stupid 
contented fellows satisfied with their position while i am still
discontented and want to do something for mankind but perhaps all these
comrades of mine struggled just like me and sought something new a
path in life of their own and like me were brought by force of
circumstances society and race by that elemental force against which
man is powerless to the condition i am in said he to himself in
moments of humility and after living some time in moscow he no longer
despised but began to grow fond of to respect and to pity his
comrades in destiny as he pitied himself 

pierre no longer suffered moments of despair hypochondria and disgust
with life but the malady that had formerly found expression in such
acute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment 
 what for why what is going on in the world he would ask himself
in perplexity several times a day involuntarily beginning to reflect
anew on the meaning of the phenomena of life but knowing by experience
that there were no answers to these questions he made haste to turn away
from them and took up a book or hurried off to the club or to apoll n
nikol evich s to exchange the gossip of the town 

 h l ne who has never cared for anything but her own body and
is one of the stupidest women in the world thought pierre is
regarded by people as the acme of intelligence and refinement and they
pay homage to her napoleon bonaparte was despised by all as long as he
was great but now that he has become a wretched comedian the emperor
francis wants to offer him his daughter in an illegal marriage the
spaniards through the catholic clergy offer praise to god for their
victory over the french on the fourteenth of june and the french 
also through the catholic clergy offer praise because on that same
fourteenth of june they defeated the spaniards my brother masons swear
by the blood that they are ready to sacrifice everything for their
neighbor but they do not give a ruble each to the collections for the
poor and they intrigue the astraea lodge against the manna seekers 
and fuss about an authentic scotch carpet and a charter that nobody
needs and the meaning of which the very man who wrote it does not
understand we all profess the christian law of forgiveness of injuries
and love of our neighbors the law in honor of which we have built in
moscow forty times forty churches but yesterday a deserter was knouted
to death and a minister of that same law of love and forgiveness a
priest gave the soldier a cross to kiss before his execution so
thought pierre and the whole of this general deception which everyone
accepts accustomed as he was to it astonished him each time as if it
were something new i understand the deception and confusion he
thought but how am i to tell them all that i see i have tried and
have always found that they too in the depths of their souls understand
it as i do and only try not to see it so it appears that it must
be so but i what is to become of me thought he he had the
unfortunate capacity many men especially russians have of seeing and
believing in the possibility of goodness and truth but of seeing the
evil and falsehood of life too clearly to be able to take a serious part
in it every sphere of work was connected in his eyes with evil and
deception whatever he tried to be whatever he engaged in the evil and
falsehood of it repulsed him and blocked every path of activity yet he
had to live and to find occupation it was too dreadful to be under
the burden of these insoluble problems so he abandoned himself to
any distraction in order to forget them he frequented every kind of
society drank much bought pictures engaged in building and above
all read 

he read and read everything that came to hand on coming home while
his valets were still taking off his things he picked up a book and
began to read from reading he passed to sleeping from sleeping to
gossip in drawing rooms of the club from gossip to carousals and women 
from carousals back to gossip reading and wine drinking became more
and more a physical and also a moral necessity though the doctors
warned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for him he
drank a great deal he was only quite at ease when having poured several
glasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he felt a pleasant
warmth in his body an amiability toward all his fellows and a
readiness to respond superficially to every idea without probing it
deeply only after emptying a bottle or two did he feel dimly that the
terribly tangled skein of life which previously had terrified him was
not as dreadful as he had thought he was always conscious of some
aspect of that skein as with a buzzing in his head after dinner or
supper he chatted or listened to conversation or read but under the
influence of wine he said to himself it doesn t matter i ll
get it unraveled i have a solution ready but have no time now i ll
think it all out later on but the later on never came 

in the morning on an empty stomach all the old questions appeared as
insoluble and terrible as ever and pierre hastily picked up a book and
if anyone came to see him he was glad 

sometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when
entrenched under the enemy s fire if they have nothing to do try
hard to find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger to
pierre all men seemed like those soldiers seeking refuge from life 
some in ambition some in cards some in framing laws some in women 
some in toys some in horses some in politics some in sport some
in wine and some in governmental affairs nothing is trivial and
nothing is important it s all the same only to save oneself from it
as best one can thought pierre only not to see it that dreadful
it 





chapter ii

at the beginning of winter prince nicholas bolk nski and his daughter
moved to moscow at that time enthusiasm for the emperor alexander s
regime had weakened and a patriotic and anti french tendency prevailed
there and this together with his past and his intellect and his
originality at once made prince nicholas bolk nski an object of
particular respect to the moscovites and the center of the moscow
opposition to the government 

the prince had aged very much that year he showed marked signs of
senility by a tendency to fall asleep forgetfulness of quite recent
events remembrance of remote ones and the childish vanity with which
he accepted the role of head of the moscow opposition in spite of this
the old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of respectful
veneration especially of an evening when he came in to tea in his
old fashioned coat and powdered wig and aroused by anyone told his
abrupt stories of the past or uttered yet more abrupt and scathing
criticisms of the present for them all that old fashioned house with
its gigantic mirrors pre revolution furniture powdered footmen and
the stern shrewd old man himself a relic of the past century with his
gentle daughter and the pretty frenchwoman who were reverently devoted
to him presented a majestic and agreeable spectacle but the visitors
did not reflect that besides the couple of hours during which they saw
their host there were also twenty two hours in the day during which the
private and intimate life of the house continued 

latterly that private life had become very trying for princess mary 
there in moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasures talks with
the pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at bald hills and
she had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life she did not
go out into society everyone knew that her father would not let her
go anywhere without him and his failing health prevented his going out
himself so that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties she
had quite abandoned the hope of getting married she saw the coldness
and malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed the
young men possible suitors who sometimes appeared at their house she
had no friends during this visit to moscow she had been disappointed in
the two who had been nearest to her mademoiselle bourienne with whom
she had never been able to be quite frank had now become unpleasant to
her and for various reasons princess mary avoided her julie with whom
she had corresponded for the last five years was in moscow but proved
to be quite alien to her when they met just then julie who by the
death of her brothers had become one of the richest heiresses in moscow 
was in the full whirl of society pleasures she was surrounded by young
men who she fancied had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth 
julie was at that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels
that her last chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be
decided now or never on thursdays princess mary remembered with a
mournful smile that she now had no one to write to since julie whose
presence gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week like the
old migr who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his
evenings for years she regretted julie s presence and having no one
to write to in moscow princess mary had no one to talk to no one to
whom to confide her sorrow and much sorrow fell to her lot just then 
the time for prince andrew s return and marriage was approaching but
his request to her to prepare his father for it had not been carried
out in fact it seemed as if matters were quite hopeless for at every
mention of the young countess rost va the old prince who apart from
that was usually in a bad temper lost control of himself another
lately added sorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six year old
nephew to her consternation she detected in herself in relation to
little nicholas some symptoms of her father s irritability however
often she told herself that she must not get irritable when teaching her
nephew almost every time that pointer in hand she sat down to show
him the french alphabet she so longed to pour her own knowledge quickly
and easily into the child who was already afraid that auntie might at
any moment get angry that at his slightest inattention she trembled 
became flustered and heated raised her voice and sometimes pulled him
by the arm and put him in the corner having put him in the corner
she would herself begin to cry over her cruel evil nature and little
nicholas following her example would sob and without permission would
leave his corner come to her pull her wet hands from her face and
comfort her but what distressed the princess most of all was her
father s irritability which was always directed against her and had
of late amounted to cruelty had he forced her to prostrate herself to
the ground all night had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water 
it would never have entered her mind to think her position hard but
this loving despot the more cruel because he loved her and for that
reason tormented himself and her knew how not merely to hurt and
humiliate her deliberately but to show her that she was always to blame
for everything of late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented
princess mary more than anything else this was his ever increasing
intimacy with mademoiselle bourienne the idea that at the first moment
of receiving the news of his son s intentions had occurred to him in
jest that if andrew got married he himself would marry bourienne had
evidently pleased him and latterly he had persistently and as it
seemed to princess mary merely to offend her shown special endearments
to the companion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter by
demonstrations of love of bourienne 

one day in moscow in princess mary s presence she thought her father
did it purposely when she was there the old prince kissed mademoiselle
bourienne s hand and drawing her to him embraced her affectionately 
princess mary flushed and ran out of the room a few minutes later
mademoiselle bourienne came into princess mary s room smiling and
making cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice princess mary hastily
wiped away her tears went resolutely up to mademoiselle bourienne 
and evidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry
haste at the frenchwoman her voice breaking it s horrible vile 
inhuman to take advantage of the weakness she did not finish 
 leave my room she exclaimed and burst into sobs 

next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter but she noticed
that at dinner he gave orders that mademoiselle bourienne should be
served first after dinner when the footman handed coffee and from
habit began with the princess the prince suddenly grew furious 
threw his stick at philip and instantly gave instructions to have him
conscripted for the army 

 he doesn t obey i said it twice and he doesn t obey she
is the first person in this house she s my best friend cried
the prince and if you allow yourself he screamed in a fury 
addressing princess mary for the first time to forget yourself again
before her as you dared to do yesterday i will show you who is master
in this house go don t let me set eyes on you beg her pardon 

princess mary asked mademoiselle bourienne s pardon and also her
father s pardon for herself and for philip the footman who had begged
for her intervention 

at such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her
soul and suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his
spectacles in her presence fumbling near them and not seeing them or
would forget something that had just occurred or take a false step with
his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feebleness 
or worst of all at dinner when there were no visitors to excite him
would suddenly fall asleep letting his napkin drop and his shaking
head sink over his plate he is old and feeble and i dare to condemn
him she thought at such moments with a feeling of revulsion against
herself 





chapter iii

in 1811 there was living in moscow a french doctor m tivier who had
rapidly become the fashion he was enormously tall handsome amiable
as frenchmen are and was as all moscow said an extraordinarily clever
doctor he was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor but
as an equal 

prince nicholas had always ridiculed medicine but latterly on
mademoiselle bourienne s advice had allowed this doctor to visit him
and had grown accustomed to him m tivier came to see the prince about
twice a week 

on december 6 st nicholas day and the prince s name day all
moscow came to the prince s front door but he gave orders to admit no
one and to invite to dinner only a small number a list of whom he gave
to princess mary 

m tivier who came in the morning with his felicitations considered
it proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne as he told
princess mary and went in to see the prince it happened that on that
morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods he had
been going about the house all the morning finding fault with everyone
and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not to be
understood himself princess mary well knew this mood of quiet absorbed
querulousness which generally culminated in a burst of rage and she
went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and loaded gun
and awaited the inevitable explosion until the doctor s arrival the
morning had passed off safely after admitting the doctor princess mary
sat down with a book in the drawing room near the door through which she
could hear all that passed in the study 

 to force the guard 

at first she heard only m tivier s voice then her father s then
both voices began speaking at the same time the door was flung open 
and on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified
m tivier with his shock of black hair and the prince in his dressing
gown and fez his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes
rolled downwards 

 you don t understand shouted the prince but i do french
spy slave of buonaparte spy get out of my house be off i tell
you and he slammed the door 

m tivier shrugging his shoulders went up to mademoiselle bourienne
who at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room 

 the prince is not very well bile and rush of blood to the head keep
calm i will call again tomorrow said m tivier and putting his
fingers to his lips he hastened away 

through the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry 
 spies traitors traitors everywhere not a moment s peace in my
own house 

after m tivier s departure the old prince called his daughter in and
the whole weight of his wrath fell on her she was to blame that a spy
had been admitted had he not told her yes told her to make a list 
and not to admit anyone who was not on that list then why was that
scoundrel admitted she was the cause of it all with her he said he
could not have a moment s peace and could not die quietly 

 no ma am we must part we must part understand that understand
it i cannot endure any more he said and left the room then as if
afraid she might find some means of consolation he returned and trying
to appear calm added and don t imagine i have said this in a
moment of anger i am calm i have thought it over and it will be
carried out we must part so find some place for yourself but
he could not restrain himself and with the virulence of which only one
who loves is capable evidently suffering himself he shook his fists at
her and screamed 

 if only some fool would marry her then he slammed the door sent
for mademoiselle bourienne and subsided into his study 

at two o clock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner 

these guests the famous count rostopch n prince lopukh n with his
nephew general chatr v an old war comrade of the prince s and
of the younger generation pierre and bor s drubetsk y awaited the
prince in the drawing room 

bor s who had come to moscow on leave a few days before had been
anxious to be presented to prince nicholas bolk nski and had contrived
to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his case made an
exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his house 

the prince s house did not belong to what is known as fashionable
society but his little circle though not much talked about in
town was one it was more flattering to be received in than any other 
bor s had realized this the week before when the commander in chief in
his presence invited rostopch n to dinner on st nicholas day and
rostopch n had replied that he could not come 

 on that day i always go to pay my devotions to the relics of prince
nicholas bolk nski 

 oh yes yes replied the commander in chief how is he 

the small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty old fashioned
drawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn gathering of
a court of justice all were silent or talked in low tones prince
nicholas came in serious and taciturn princess mary seemed even quieter
and more diffident than usual the guests were reluctant to address
her feeling that she was in no mood for their conversation count
rostopch n alone kept the conversation going now relating the latest
town news and now the latest political gossip 

lopukh n and the old general occasionally took part in the
conversation prince bolk nski listened as a presiding judge receives a
report only now and then silently or by a brief word showing that
he took heed of what was being reported to him the tone of the
conversation was such as indicated that no one approved of what was
being done in the political world incidents were related evidently
confirming the opinion that everything was going from bad to worse but
whether telling a story or giving an opinion the speaker always stopped 
or was stopped at the point beyond which his criticism might touch the
sovereign himself 

at dinner the talk turned on the latest political news napoleon s
seizure of the duke of oldenburg s territory and the russian note 
hostile to napoleon which had been sent to all the european courts 

 bonaparte treats europe as a pirate does a captured vessel said
count rostopch n repeating a phrase he had uttered several times
before one only wonders at the long suffering or blindness of the
crowned heads now the pope s turn has come and bonaparte doesn t
scruple to depose the head of the catholic church yet all keep silent 
our sovereign alone has protested against the seizure of the duke
of oldenburg s territory and even count rostopch n paused 
feeling that he had reached the limit beyond which censure was
impossible 

 other territories have been offered in exchange for the duchy of
oldenburg said prince bolk nski he shifts the dukes about as
i might move my serfs from bald hills to boguch rovo or my ryaz n
estates 

 the duke of oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable
strength of character and resignation remarked bor s joining in
respectfully 

he said this because on his journey from petersburg he had had the honor
of being presented to the duke prince bolk nski glanced at the
young man as if about to say something in reply but changed his mind 
evidently considering him too young 

 i have read our protests about the oldenburg affair and was surprised
how badly the note was worded remarked count rostopch n in the
casual tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him 

pierre looked at rostopch n with na ve astonishment not understanding
why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the note 

 does it matter count how the note is worded he asked so
long as its substance is forcible 

 my dear fellow with our five hundred thousand troops it should be
easy to have a good style returned count rostopch n 

pierre now understood the count s dissatisfaction with the wording of
the note 

 one would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up 
remarked the old prince there in petersburg they are always
writing not notes only but even new laws my andrew there has written
a whole volume of laws for russia nowadays they are always writing 
and he laughed unnaturally 

there was a momentary pause in the conversation the old general cleared
his throat to draw attention 

 did you hear of the last event at the review in petersburg the
figure cut by the new french ambassador 

 eh yes i heard something he said something awkward in his
majesty s presence 

 his majesty drew attention to the grenadier division and to the march
past continued the general and it seems the ambassador took
no notice and allowed himself to reply that we in france pay no
attention to such trifles the emperor did not condescend to reply 
at the next review they say the emperor did not once deign to address
him 

all were silent on this fact relating to the emperor personally it was
impossible to pass any judgment 

 impudent fellows said the prince you know m tivier i turned
him out of my house this morning he was here they admitted him in
spite of my request that they should let no one in he went on 
glancing angrily at his daughter 

and he narrated his whole conversation with the french doctor and
the reasons that convinced him that m tivier was a spy though these
reasons were very insufficient and obscure no one made any rejoinder 

after the roast champagne was served the guests rose to congratulate
the old prince princess mary too went round to him 

he gave her a cold angry look and offered her his wrinkled 
clean shaven cheek to kiss the whole expression of his face told
her that he had not forgotten the morning s talk that his decision
remained in force and only the presence of visitors hindered his
speaking of it to her now 

when they went into the drawing room where coffee was served the old
men sat together 

prince nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the
impending war 

he said that our wars with bonaparte would be disastrous so long as we
sought alliances with the germans and thrust ourselves into european
affairs into which we had been drawn by the peace of tilsit we
ought not to fight either for or against austria our political
interests are all in the east and in regard to bonaparte the only thing
is to have an armed frontier and a firm policy and he will never dare
to cross the russian frontier as was the case in 1807 

 how can we fight the french prince said count rostopch n 
 can we arm ourselves against our teachers and divinities look at
our youths look at our ladies the french are our gods paris is our
kingdom of heaven 

he began speaking louder evidently to be heard by everyone 

 french dresses french ideas french feelings there now you turned
m tivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a frenchman and
a scoundrel but our ladies crawl after him on their knees i went to
a party last night and there out of five ladies three were roman
catholics and had the pope s indulgence for doing woolwork on sundays 
and they themselves sit there nearly naked like the signboards at our
public baths if i may say so ah when one looks at our young people 
prince one would like to take peter the great s old cudgel out of the
museum and belabor them in the russian way till all the nonsense jumps
out of them 

all were silent the old prince looked at rostopch n with a smile and
wagged his head approvingly 

 well good by your excellency keep well said rostopch n 
getting up with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to the
prince 

 good by my dear fellow his words are music i never tire of
hearing him said the old prince keeping hold of the hand and
offering his cheek to be kissed 

following rostopch n s example the others also rose 





chapter iv

princess mary as she sat listening to the old men s talk and
faultfinding understood nothing of what she heard she only wondered
whether the guests had all observed her father s hostile attitude
toward her she did not even notice the special attentions and
amiabilities shown her during dinner by bor s drubetsk y who was
visiting them for the third time already 

princess mary turned with absent minded questioning look to pierre who
hat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of the guests to
approach her after the old prince had gone out and they were left alone
in the drawing room 

 may i stay a little longer he said letting his stout body sink
into an armchair beside her 

 oh yes she answered you noticed nothing her look asked 

pierre was in an agreeable after dinner mood he looked straight before
him and smiled quietly 

 have you known that young man long princess he asked 

 who 

 drubetsk y 

 no not long 

 do you like him 

 yes he is an agreeable young man why do you ask me that said
princess mary still thinking of that morning s conversation with her
father 

 because i have noticed that when a young man comes on leave from
petersburg to moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an
heiress 

 you have observed that said princess mary 

 yes returned pierre with a smile and this young man now
manages matters so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is
too i can read him like a book at present he is hesitating whom to lay
siege to you or mademoiselle julie kar gina he is very attentive to
her 

 he visits them 

 yes very often and do you know the new way of courting said
pierre with an amused smile evidently in that cheerful mood of good
humored raillery for which he so often reproached himself in his diary 

 no replied princess mary 

 to please moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy he is very
melancholy with mademoiselle kar gina said pierre 

 really asked princess mary looking into pierre s kindly
face and still thinking of her own sorrow it would be a relief 
thought she if i ventured to confide what i am feeling to someone 
i should like to tell everything to pierre he is kind and generous it
would be a relief he would give me advice 

 would you marry him 

 oh my god count there are moments when i would marry anybody 
she cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice 
 ah how bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel
that she went on in a trembling voice that you can do nothing
for him but grieve him and to know that you cannot alter this then
there is only one thing left to go away but where could i go 

 what is wrong what is it princess 

but without finishing what she was saying princess mary burst into
tears 

 i don t know what is the matter with me today don t take any
notice forget what i have said 

pierre s gaiety vanished completely he anxiously questioned the
princess asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him but
she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said that
she did not remember what she had said and that she had no trouble
except the one he knew of that prince andrew s marriage threatened
to cause a rupture between father and son 

 have you any news of the rost vs she asked to change the
subject i was told they are coming soon i am also expecting andrew
any day i should like them to meet here 

 and how does he now regard the matter asked pierre referring to
the old prince 

princess mary shook her head 

 what is to be done in a few months the year will be up the thing
is impossible i only wish i could spare my brother the first moments 
i wish they would come sooner i hope to be friends with her you have
known them a long time said princess mary tell me honestly
the whole truth what sort of girl is she and what do you think of
her the real truth because you know andrew is risking so much doing
this against his father s will that i should like to know 

an undefined instinct told pierre that these explanations and
repeated requests to be told the whole truth expressed ill will on
the princess part toward her future sister in law and a wish that
he should disapprove of andrew s choice but in reply he said what he
felt rather than what he thought 

 i don t know how to answer your question he said blushing
without knowing why i really don t know what sort of girl she is 
i can t analyze her at all she is enchanting but what makes her so i
don t know that is all one can say about her 

princess mary sighed and the expression on her face said yes 
that s what i expected and feared 

 is she clever she asked 

pierre considered 

 i think not he said and yet yes she does not deign to be
clever oh no she is simply enchanting and that is all 

princess mary again shook her head disapprovingly 

 ah i so long to like her tell her so if you see her before i do 

 i hear they are expected very soon said pierre 

princess mary told pierre of her plan to become intimate with her future
sister in law as soon as the rost vs arrived and to try to accustom the
old prince to her 





chapter v

bor s had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in petersburg so
with the same object in view he came to moscow there he wavered between
the two richest heiresses julie and princess mary though princess
mary despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than julie he 
without knowing why felt awkward about paying court to her when they
had last met on the old prince s name day she had answered at random
all his attempts to talk sentimentally evidently not listening to what
he was saying 

julie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily though in a
manner peculiar to herself 

she was twenty seven after the death of her brothers she had become
very wealthy she was by now decidedly plain but thought herself not
merely as good looking as before but even far more attractive she
was confirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a very
wealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew the less
dangerous she became to men and the more freely they could associate
with her and avail themselves of her suppers soirees and the animated
company that assembled at her house without incurring any obligation 
a man who would have been afraid ten years before of going every day
to the house when there was a girl of seventeen there for fear of
compromising her and committing himself would now go boldly every day
and treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintance 

that winter the kar gins house was the most agreeable and hospitable
in moscow in addition to the formal evening and dinner parties a large
company chiefly of men gathered there every day supping at midnight
and staying till three in the morning julie never missed a ball a
promenade or a play her dresses were always of the latest fashion 
but in spite of that she seemed to be disillusioned about everything and
told everyone that she did not believe either in friendship or in love 
or any of the joys of life and expected peace only yonder she
adopted the tone of one who has suffered a great disappointment like a
girl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by
him though nothing of the kind had happened to her she was regarded in
that light and had even herself come to believe that she had suffered
much in life this melancholy which did not prevent her amusing
herself did not hinder the young people who came to her house from
passing the time pleasantly every visitor who came to the house paid
his tribute to the melancholy mood of the hostess and then amused
himself with society gossip dancing intellectual games and bouts
rim s which were in vogue at the kar gins only a few of these
young men among them bor s entered more deeply into julie s
melancholy and with these she had prolonged conversations in private
on the vanity of all worldly things and to them she showed her albums
filled with mournful sketches maxims and verses 

to bor s julie was particularly gracious she regretted his early
disillusionment with life offered him such consolation of friendship
as she who had herself suffered so much could render and showed him
her album bor s sketched two trees in the album and wrote rustic
trees your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me 

on another page he drew a tomb and wrote 

 la mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille 
 ah contre les douleurs il n y a pas d autre asile 

 death gives relief and death is peaceful 

ah from suffering there is no other refuge 

julie said this was charming

 there is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy she
said to bor s repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a
book it is a ray of light in the darkness a shade between sadness
and despair showing the possibility of consolation 

in reply bor s wrote these lines 

 aliment de poison d une me trop sensible 
 toi sans qui le bonheur me serait impossible 
 tendre m lancholie ah viens me consoler 
 viens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite 
 et m le une douceur secr te
 a ces pleurs que je sens couler 

 poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul 
 thou without whom happiness would for me be impossible 
 tender melancholy ah come to console me 
 come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat 
 and mingle a secret sweetness
 with these tears that i feel to be flowing 

for bor s julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp bor s
read poor liza aloud to her and more than once interrupted the reading
because of the emotions that choked him meeting at large gatherings
julie and bor s looked on one another as the only souls who understood
one another in a world of indifferent people 

anna mikh ylovna who often visited the kar gins while playing cards
with the mother made careful inquiries as to julie s dowry she was
to have two estates in p nza and the nizheg rod forests anna
mikh ylovna regarded the refined sadness that united her son to the
wealthy julie with emotion and resignation to the divine will 

 you are always charming and melancholy my dear julie she said to
the daughter bor s says his soul finds repose at your house he has
suffered so many disappointments and is so sensitive said she to
the mother ah my dear i can t tell you how fond i have grown
of julie latterly she said to her son but who could help loving
her she is an angelic being ah bor s bor s she paused 
 and how i pity her mother she went on today she showed me her
accounts and letters from p nza they have enormous estates there and
she poor thing has no one to help her and they do cheat her so 

bor s smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother he
laughed blandly at her na ve diplomacy but listened to what she had
to say and sometimes questioned her carefully about the p nza and
nizheg rod estates 

julie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy adorer and
was ready to accept it but some secret feeling of repulsion for her 
for her passionate desire to get married for her artificiality and
a feeling of horror at renouncing the possibility of real love still
restrained bor s his leave was expiring he spent every day and whole
days at the kar gins and every day on thinking the matter over
told himself that he would propose tomorrow but in julie s presence 
looking at her red face and chin nearly always powdered her moist
eyes and her expression of continual readiness to pass at once from
melancholy to an unnatural rapture of married bliss bor s could not
utter the decisive words though in imagination he had long regarded
himself as the possessor of those p nza and nizheg rod estates and
had apportioned the use of the income from them julie saw bor s 
indecision and sometimes the thought occurred to her that she was
repulsive to him but her feminine self deception immediately supplied
her with consolation and she told herself that he was only shy from
love her melancholy however began to turn to irritability and not
long before bor s departure she formed a definite plan of action 
just as bor s leave of absence was expiring anatole kur gin made
his appearance in moscow and of course in the kar gins drawing
room and julie suddenly abandoning her melancholy became cheerful and
very attentive to kur gin 

 my dear said anna mikh ylovna to her son i know from a
reliable source that prince vas li has sent his son to moscow to get
him married to julie i am so fond of julie that i should be sorry for
her what do you think of it my dear 

the idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that whole
month of arduous melancholy service to julie and of seeing all
the revenue from the p nza estates which he had already mentally
apportioned and put to proper use fall into the hands of another and
especially into the hands of that idiot anatole pained bor s he drove
to the kar gins with the firm intention of proposing julie met
him in a gay careless manner spoke casually of how she had enjoyed
yesterday s ball and asked when he was leaving though bor s had
come intentionally to speak of his love and therefore meant to be
tender he began speaking irritably of feminine inconstancy of how
easily women can turn from sadness to joy and how their moods depend
solely on who happens to be paying court to them julie was offended and
replied that it was true that a woman needs variety and the same thing
over and over again would weary anyone 

 then i should advise you bor s began wishing to sting her 
but at that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might
have to leave moscow without having accomplished his aim and have
vainly wasted his efforts which was a thing he never allowed to
happen 

he checked himself in the middle of the sentence lowered his eyes to
avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face and said 

 i did not come here at all to quarrel with you on the contrary 

he glanced at her to make sure that he might go on her irritability had
suddenly quite vanished and her anxious imploring eyes were fixed on
him with greedy expectation i can always arrange so as not to see
her often thought bor s the affair has been begun and must be
finished he blushed hotly raised his eyes to hers and said 

 you know my feelings for you 

there was no need to say more julie s face shone with triumph and
self satisfaction but she forced bor s to say all that is said on such
occasions that he loved her and had never loved any other woman more
than her she knew that for the p nza estates and nizheg rod forests
she could demand this and she received what she demanded 

the affianced couple no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom and
melancholy upon them planned the arrangements of a splendid house in
petersburg paid calls and prepared everything for a brilliant wedding 





chapter vi

at the end of january old count rost v went to moscow with nat sha and
s nya the countess was still unwell and unable to travel but it was
impossible to wait for her recovery prince andrew was expected in
moscow any day the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near
moscow had to be sold besides which the opportunity of presenting his
future daughter in law to old prince bolk nski while he was in moscow
could not be missed the rost vs moscow house had not been heated
that winter and as they had come only for a short time and the countess
was not with them the count decided to stay with m rya dm trievna
akhros mova who had long been pressing her hospitality on them 

late one evening the rost vs four sleighs drove into m rya
dm trievna s courtyard in the old kony sheny street m rya
dm trievna lived alone she had already married off her daughter and
her sons were all in the service 

she held herself as erect told everyone her opinion as candidly 
loudly and bluntly as ever and her whole bearing seemed a reproach
to others for any weakness passion or temptation the possibility of
which she did not admit from early in the morning wearing a dressing
jacket she attended to her household affairs and then she drove out 
on holy days to church and after the service to jails and prisons on
affairs of which she never spoke to anyone on ordinary days after
dressing she received petitioners of various classes of whom there
were always some then she had dinner a substantial and appetizing meal
at which there were always three or four guests after dinner she played
a game of boston and at night she had the newspapers or a new book read
to her while she knitted she rarely made an exception and went out to
pay visits and then only to the most important persons in the town 

she had not yet gone to bed when the rost vs arrived and the pulley of
the hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the rost vs and their
servants m rya dm trievna with her spectacles hanging down on her
nose and her head flung back stood in the hall doorway looking with
a stern grim face at the new arrivals one might have thought she was
angry with the travelers and would immediately turn them out had she
not at the same time been giving careful instructions to the servants
for the accommodation of the visitors and their belongings 

 the count s things bring them here she said pointing to the
portmanteaus and not greeting anyone the young ladies there
to the left now what are you dawdling for she cried to the maids 
 get the samovar ready you ve grown plumper and prettier she
remarked drawing nat sha whose cheeks were glowing from the cold 
to her by the hood foo you are cold now take off your things 
quick she shouted to the count who was going to kiss her hand 
 you re half frozen i m sure bring some rum for tea bonjour 
s nya dear she added turning to s nya and indicating by this
french greeting her slightly contemptuous though affectionate attitude
toward her 

when they came in to tea having taken off their outdoor things and
tidied themselves up after their journey m rya dm trievna kissed them
all in due order 

 i m heartily glad you have come and are staying with me it was
high time she said giving nat sha a significant look the old
man is here and his son s expected any day you ll have to make his
acquaintance but we ll speak of that later on she added glancing
at s nya with a look that showed she did not want to speak of it in her
presence now listen she said to the count what do you want
tomorrow whom will you send for shinsh n she crooked one of her
fingers the sniveling anna mikh ylovna that s two she s here
with her son the son is getting married then bez khov eh he is here
too with his wife he ran away from her and she came galloping after
him he dined with me on wednesday as for them and she pointed to
the girls tomorrow i ll take them first to the iberian shrine
of the mother of god and then we ll drive to the super rogue s 
i suppose you ll have everything new don t judge by me sleeves
nowadays are this size the other day young princess ir na vas levna
came to see me she was an awful sight looked as if she had put two
barrels on her arms you know not a day passes now without some new
fashion and what have you to do yourself she asked the count
sternly 

 one thing has come on top of another her rags to buy and now a
purchaser has turned up for the moscow estate and for the house if you
will be so kind i ll fix a time and go down to the estate just for a
day and leave my lassies with you 

 all right all right they ll be safe with me as safe as in
chancery i ll take them where they must go scold them a bit and
pet them a bit said m rya dm trievna touching her goddaughter and
favorite nat sha on the cheek with her large hand 

next morning m rya dm trievna took the young ladies to the iberian
shrine of the mother of god and to madame suppert roguet who was so
afraid of m rya dm trievna that she always let her have costumes at
a loss merely to get rid of her m rya dm trievna ordered almost the
whole trousseau when they got home she turned everybody out of the room
except nat sha and then called her pet to her armchair 

 well now we ll talk i congratulate you on your betrothed 
you ve hooked a fine fellow i am glad for your sake and i ve known
him since he was so high she held her hand a couple of feet from the
ground nat sha blushed happily i like him and all his family 
now listen you know that old prince nicholas much dislikes his son s
marrying the old fellow s crotchety of course prince andrew is not
a child and can shift without him but it s not nice to enter a family
against a father s will one wants to do it peacefully and lovingly 
you re a clever girl and you ll know how to manage be kind and use
your wits then all will be well 

nat sha remained silent from shyness m rya dm trievna supposed but
really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her love
of prince andrew which seemed to her so apart from all human affairs
that no one could understand it she loved and knew prince andrew he
loved her only and was to come one of these days and take her she
wanted nothing more 

 you see i have known him a long time and am also fond of mary your
future sister in law husbands sisters bring up blisters 
but this one wouldn t hurt a fly she has asked me to bring you two
together tomorrow you ll go with your father to see her be very
nice and affectionate to her you re younger than she when he comes 
he ll find you already know his sister and father and are liked by
them am i right or not won t that be best 

 yes it will nat sha answered reluctantly 





chapter vii

next day by m rya dm trievna s advice count rost v took nat sha
to call on prince nicholas bolk nski the count did not set out
cheerfully on this visit at heart he felt afraid he well remembered
the last interview he had had with the old prince at the time of the
enrollment when in reply to an invitation to dinner he had had to
listen to an angry reprimand for not having provided his full quota of
men nat sha on the other hand having put on her best gown was in
the highest spirits they can t help liking me she thought 
 everybody always has liked me and i am so willing to do anything
they wish so ready to be fond of him for being his father and of
her for being his sister that there is no reason for them not to
like me 

they drove up to the gloomy old house on the vozdv zhenka and entered
the vestibule 

 well the lord have mercy on us said the count half in jest 
half in earnest but nat sha noticed that her father was flurried on
entering the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince
and princess were at home 

when they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the
servants the footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by
another in the large hall and they whispered to one another then a
maidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something mentioning
the princess at last an old cross looking footman came and announced
to the rost vs that the prince was not receiving but that the princess
begged them to walk up the first person who came to meet the visitors
was mademoiselle bourienne she greeted the father and daughter
with special politeness and showed them to the princess room the
princess looking excited and nervous her face flushed in patches ran
in to meet the visitors treading heavily and vainly trying to appear
cordial and at ease from the first glance princess mary did not like
nat sha she thought her too fashionably dressed frivolously gay and
vain she did not at all realize that before having seen her future
sister in law she was prejudiced against her by involuntary envy of her
beauty youth and happiness as well as by jealousy of her brother s
love for her apart from this insuperable antipathy to her princess
mary was agitated just then because on the rost vs being announced 
the old prince had shouted that he did not wish to see them that
princess mary might do so if she chose but they were not to be admitted
to him she had decided to receive them but feared lest the prince
might at any moment indulge in some freak as he seemed much upset by
the rost vs visit 

 there my dear princess i ve brought you my songstress said
the count bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old prince
might appear i am so glad you should get to know one another very
sorry the prince is still ailing and after a few more commonplace
remarks he rose if you ll allow me to leave my nat sha in your
hands for a quarter of an hour princess i ll drive round to see anna
sem novna it s quite near in the dogs square and then i ll
come back for her 

the count had devised this diplomatic ruse as he afterwards told his
daughter to give the future sisters in law an opportunity to talk
to one another freely but another motive was to avoid the danger of
encountering the old prince of whom he was afraid he did not mention
this to his daughter but nat sha noticed her father s nervousness
and anxiety and felt mortified by it she blushed for him grew still
angrier at having blushed and looked at the princess with a bold and
defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody the
princess told the count that she would be delighted and only begged him
to stay longer at anna sem novna s and he departed 

despite the uneasy glances thrown at her by princess mary who wished
to have a t te t te with nat sha mademoiselle bourienne
remained in the room and persistently talked about moscow amusements and
theaters nat sha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in
the anteroom by her father s nervousness and by the unnatural manner
of the princess who she thought was making a favor of receiving her 
and so everything displeased her she did not like princess mary whom
she thought very plain affected and dry nat sha suddenly shrank
into herself and involuntarily assumed an offhand air which alienated
princess mary still more after five minutes of irksome constrained
conversation they heard the sound of slippered feet rapidly
approaching princess mary looked frightened 

the door opened and the old prince in a dressing gown and a white
nightcap came in 

 ah madam he began madam countess countess rost va if
i am not mistaken i beg you to excuse me to excuse me i did not
know madam god is my witness i did not know you had honored us with
a visit and i came in such a costume only to see my daughter i beg you
to excuse me god is my witness i didn t know he repeated 
stressing the word god so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that
princess mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at her
father or at nat sha 

nor did the latter having risen and curtsied know what to do 
mademoiselle bourienne alone smiled agreeably 

 i beg you to excuse me excuse me god is my witness i did not
know muttered the old man and after looking nat sha over from head
to foot he went out 

mademoiselle bourienne was the first to recover herself after this
apparition and began speaking about the prince s indisposition 
nat sha and princess mary looked at one another in silence and the
longer they did so without saying what they wanted to say the greater
grew their antipathy to one another 

when the count returned nat sha was impolitely pleased and hastened
to get away at that moment she hated the stiff elderly princess who
could place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an
hour with her without once mentioning prince andrew i couldn t
begin talking about him in the presence of that frenchwoman thought
nat sha the same thought was meanwhile tormenting princess mary she
knew what she ought to have said to nat sha but she had been unable
to say it because mademoiselle bourienne was in the way and because 
without knowing why she felt it very difficult to speak of the
marriage when the count was already leaving the room princess mary
went up hurriedly to nat sha took her by the hand and said with a
deep sigh 

 wait i must 

nat sha glanced at her ironically without knowing why 

 dear natalie said princess mary i want you to know that i am
glad my brother has found happiness 

she paused feeling that she was not telling the truth nat sha noticed
this and guessed its reason 

 i think princess it is not convenient to speak of that now 
she said with external dignity and coldness though she felt the tears
choking her 

 what have i said and what have i done thought she as soon as she
was out of the room 

they waited a long time for nat sha to come to dinner that day she sat
in her room crying like a child blowing her nose and sobbing s nya
stood beside her kissing her hair 

 nat sha what is it about she asked what do they matter to
you it will all pass nat sha 

 but if you only knew how offensive it was as if i 

 don t talk about it nat sha it wasn t your fault so why should
you mind kiss me said s nya 

nat sha raised her head and kissing her friend on the lips pressed
her wet face against her 

 i can t tell you i don t know no one s to blame said
nat sha it s my fault but it all hurts terribly oh why
doesn t he come 

she came in to dinner with red eyes m rya dm trievna who knew how
the prince had received the rost vs pretended not to notice how upset
nat sha was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the count
and the other guests 





chapter viii

that evening the rost vs went to the opera for which m rya
dm trievna had taken a box 

nat sha did not want to go but could not refuse m rya dm trievna s
kind offer which was intended expressly for her when she came ready
dressed into the ballroom to await her father and looking in the large
mirror there saw that she was pretty very pretty she felt even more
sad but it was a sweet tender sadness 

 o god if he were here now i would not behave as i did then but
differently i would not be silly and afraid of things i would simply
embrace him cling to him and make him look at me with those searching
inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me and then i
would make him laugh as he used to laugh and his eyes how i see those
eyes thought nat sha and what do his father and sister matter
to me i love him alone him him with that face and those eyes with
his smile manly and yet childlike no i had better not think of
him not think of him but forget him quite forget him for the present 
i can t bear this waiting and i shall cry in a minute and she
turned away from the glass making an effort not to cry and how
can s nya love nicholas so calmly and quietly and wait so long and so
patiently thought she looking at s nya who also came in quite
ready with a fan in her hand no she s altogether different i
can t 

nat sha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it was not
enough for her to love and know she was beloved she wanted now at
once to embrace the man she loved to speak and hear from him words of
love such as filled her heart while she sat in the carriage beside her
father pensively watching the lights of the street lamps flickering on
the frozen window she felt still sadder and more in love and forgot
where she was going and with whom having fallen into the line of
carriages the rost vs carriage drove up to the theater its wheels
squeaking over the snow nat sha and s nya holding up their dresses 
jumped out quickly the count got out helped by the footmen and 
passing among men and women who were entering and the program sellers 
they all three went along the corridor to the first row of boxes 
through the closed doors the music was already audible 

 nat sha your hair whispered s nya 

an attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and
opened the door of their box the music sounded louder and through the
door rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and
shoulders and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms glittered before
their eyes a lady entering the next box shot a glance of feminine envy
at nat sha the curtain had not yet risen and the overture was being
played nat sha smoothing her gown went in with s nya and sat down 
scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite a sensation she had not
experienced for a long time that of hundreds of eyes looking at
her bare arms and neck suddenly affected her both agreeably and
disagreeably and called up a whole crowd of memories desires and
emotions associated with that feeling 

the two remarkably pretty girls nat sha and s nya with count rost v
who had not been seen in moscow for a long time attracted general
attention moreover everybody knew vaguely of nat sha s engagement
to prince andrew and knew that the rost vs had lived in the country
ever since and all looked with curiosity at a fianc e who was making
one of the best matches in russia 

nat sha s looks as everyone told her had improved in the country 
and that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly pretty 
she struck those who saw her by her fullness of life and beauty 
combined with her indifference to everything about her her black eyes
looked at the crowd without seeking anyone and her delicate arm bare
to above the elbow lay on the velvet edge of the box while evidently
unconsciously she opened and closed her hand in time to the music 
crumpling her program look there s al nina said s nya 
 with her mother isn t it 

 dear me michael kir lovich has grown still stouter remarked the
count 

 look at our anna mikh ylovna what a headdress she has on 

 the kar gins julie and bor s with them one can see at once that
they re engaged 

 drubetsk y has proposed 

 oh yes i heard it today said shinsh n coming into the
rost vs box 

nat sha looked in the direction in which her father s eyes were
turned and saw julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on her
face and a string of pearls round her thick red neck which nat sha
knew was covered with powder behind them wearing a smile and leaning
over with an ear to julie s mouth was bor s handsome smoothly
brushed head he looked at the rost vs from under his brows and said
something smiling to his betrothed 

 they are talking about us about me and him thought nat sha 
 and he no doubt is calming her jealousy of me they needn t trouble
themselves if only they knew how little i am concerned about any of
them 

behind them sat anna mikh ylovna wearing a green headdress and with a
happy look of resignation to the will of god on her face their box was
pervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which nat sha knew
so well and liked so much she turned away and suddenly remembered all
that had been so humiliating in her morning s visit 

 what right has he not to wish to receive me into his family oh 
better not think of it not till he comes back she told herself 
and began looking at the faces some strange and some familiar in
the stalls in the front in the very center leaning back against
the orchestra rail stood d lokhov in a persian dress his curly hair
brushed up into a huge shock he stood in full view of the audience 
well aware that he was attracting everyone s attention yet as much at
ease as though he were in his own room around him thronged moscow s
most brilliant young men whom he evidently dominated 

the count laughing nudged the blushing s nya and pointed to her
former adorer 

 do you recognize him said he and where has he sprung from 
he asked turning to shinsh n didn t he vanish somewhere 

 he did replied shinsh n he was in the caucasus and ran
away from there they say he has been acting as minister to some ruling
prince in persia where he killed the shah s brother now all the
moscow ladies are mad about him it s d lokhov the persian that
does it we never hear a word but d lokhov is mentioned they swear
by him they offer him to you as they would a dish of choice sterlet 
d lokhov and anatole kur gin have turned all our ladies heads 

a tall beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed
plump white shoulders and neck round which she wore a double string of
large pearls entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk dress
and took a long time settling into her place 

nat sha involuntarily gazed at that neck those shoulders and pearls
and coiffure and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the pearls 
while nat sha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the lady
looked round and meeting the count s eyes nodded to him and smiled 
she was the countess bez khova pierre s wife and the count who
knew everyone in society leaned over and spoke to her 

 have you been here long countess he inquired i ll call 
i ll call to kiss your hand i m here on business and have brought
my girls with me they say sem nova acts marvelously count pierre
never used to forget us is he here 

 yes he meant to look in answered h l ne and glanced
attentively at nat sha 

count rost v resumed his seat 

 handsome isn t she he whispered to nat sha 

 wonderful answered nat sha she s a woman one could easily
fall in love with 

just then the last chords of the overture were heard and the conductor
tapped with his stick some latecomers took their seats in the stalls 
and the curtain rose 

as soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent and
all the men old and young in uniform and evening dress and all the
women with gems on their bare flesh turned their whole attention with
eager curiosity to the stage nat sha too began to look at it 





chapter ix

the floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards at the sides was
some painted cardboard representing trees and at the back was a cloth
stretched over boards in the center of the stage sat some girls in red
bodices and white skirts one very fat girl in a white silk dress sat
apart on a low bench to the back of which a piece of green cardboard
was glued they all sang something when they had finished their song
the girl in white went up to the prompter s box and a man with tight
silk trousers over his stout legs and holding a plume and a dagger 
went up to her and began singing waving his arms about 

first the man in the tight trousers sang alone then she sang then they
both paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand
of the girl in white obviously awaiting the beat to start singing with
her they sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping
and shouting while the man and woman on the stage who represented
lovers began smiling spreading out their arms and bowing 

after her life in the country and in her present serious mood all this
seemed grotesque and amazing to nat sha she could not follow the opera
nor even listen to the music she saw only the painted cardboard and the
queerly dressed men and women who moved spoke and sang so strangely in
that brilliant light she knew what it was all meant to represent but
it was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed
for the actors and then amused at them she looked at the faces of the
audience seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she
herself experienced but they all seemed attentive to what was happening
on the stage and expressed delight which to nat sha seemed feigned 
 i suppose it has to be like this she thought she kept looking
round in turn at the rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at
the seminude women in the boxes especially at h l ne in the next box 
who apparently quite unclothed sat with a quiet tranquil smile not
taking her eyes off the stage and feeling the bright light that flooded
the whole place and the warm air heated by the crowd nat sha little
by little began to pass into a state of intoxication she had not
experienced for a long while she did not realize who and where she
was nor what was going on before her as she looked and thought the
strangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through her
mind the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box and
singing the air the actress was singing then she wished to touch with
her fan an old gentleman sitting not far from her then to lean over to
h l ne and tickle her 

at a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song a door
leading to the stalls on the side nearest the rost vs box creaked 
and the steps of a belated arrival were heard there s kur gin 
whispered shinsh n countess bez khova turned smiling to the newcomer 
and nat sha following the direction of that look saw an exceptionally
handsome adjutant approaching their box with a self assured yet
courteous bearing this was anatole kur gin whom she had seen
and noticed long ago at the ball in petersburg he was now in an
adjutant s uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot he moved with
a restrained swagger which would have been ridiculous had he not been
so good looking and had his handsome face not worn such an expression
of good humored complacency and gaiety though the performance was
proceeding he walked deliberately down the carpeted gangway his sword
and spurs slightly jingling and his handsome perfumed head held high 
having looked at nat sha he approached his sister laid his well gloved
hand on the edge of her box nodded to her and leaning forward asked a
question with a motion toward nat sha 

 mais charmante said he evidently referring to nat sha who did
not exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of his
lips then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat down
beside d lokhov nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand way
that d lokhov whom others treated so fawningly he winked at him gaily 
smiled and rested his foot against the orchestra screen 

 how like the brother is to the sister remarked the count and
how handsome they both are 

shinsh n lowering his voice began to tell the count of some intrigue
of kur gin s in moscow and nat sha tried to overhear it just
because he had said she was charmante 

the first act was over in the stalls everyone began moving about going
out and coming in 

bor s came to the rost vs box received their congratulations very
simply and raising his eyebrows with an absent minded smile conveyed to
nat sha and s nya his fianc e s invitation to her wedding and
went away nat sha with a gay coquettish smile talked to him and
congratulated on his approaching wedding that same bor s with whom
she had formerly been in love in the state of intoxication she was in 
everything seemed simple and natural 

the scantily clad h l ne smiled at everyone in the same way and
nat sha gave bor s a similar smile 

h l ne s box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most
distinguished and intellectual men who seemed to vie with one another
in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her 

during the whole of that entr acte kur gin stood with d lokhov
in front of the orchestra partition looking at the rost vs box 
nat sha knew he was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure 
she even turned so that he should see her profile in what she thought
was its most becoming aspect before the beginning of the second act
pierre appeared in the stalls the rost vs had not seen him since
their arrival his face looked sad and he had grown still stouter since
nat sha last saw him he passed up to the front rows not noticing
anyone anatole went up to him and began speaking to him looking at and
indicating the rost vs box on seeing nat sha pierre grew animated
and hastily passing between the rows came toward their box when he
got there he leaned on his elbows and smiling talked to her for a long
time while conversing with pierre nat sha heard a man s voice in
countess bez khova s box and something told her it was kur gin she
turned and their eyes met almost smiling he gazed straight into her
eyes with such an enraptured caressing look that it seemed strange to be
so near him to look at him like that to be so sure he admired her and
not to be acquainted with him 

in the second act there was scenery representing tombstones there was a
round hole in the canvas to represent the moon shades were raised over
the footlights and from horns and contrabass came deep notes while many
people appeared from right and left wearing black cloaks and holding
things like daggers in their hands they began waving their arms then
some other people ran in and began dragging away the maiden who had been
in white and was now in light blue they did not drag her away at once 
but sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off and
behind the scenes something metallic was struck three times and
everyone knelt down and sang a prayer all these things were repeatedly
interrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience 

during this act every time nat sha looked toward the stalls she saw
anatole kur gin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair 
staring at her she was pleased to see that he was captivated by her and
it did not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it 

when the second act was over countess bez khova rose turned to the
rost vs box her whole bosom completely exposed beckoned the old
count with a gloved finger and paying no attention to those who had
entered her box began talking to him with an amiable smile 

 do make me acquainted with your charming daughters said she 
 the whole town is singing their praises and i don t even know
them 

nat sha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess she was so pleased
by praise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with pleasure 

 i want to become a moscovite too now said h l ne how is it
you re not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country 

countess bez khova quite deserved her reputation of being a fascinating
woman she could say what she did not think especially what was
flattering quite simply and naturally 

 dear count you must let me look after your daughters though i am
not staying here long this time nor are you i will try to amuse
them i have already heard much of you in petersburg and wanted to get
to know you said she to nat sha with her stereotyped and lovely
smile i had heard about you from my page drubetsk y have you
heard he is getting married and also from my husband s friend
bolk nski prince andrew bolk nski she went on with special
emphasis implying that she knew of his relation to nat sha to get
better acquainted she asked that one of the young ladies should come
into her box for the rest of the performance and nat sha moved over to
it 

the scene of the third act represented a palace in which many candles
were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on the
walls in the middle stood what were probably a king and a queen the
king waved his right arm and evidently nervous sang something badly
and sat down on a crimson throne the maiden who had been first in white
and then in light blue now wore only a smock and stood beside the
throne with her hair down she sang something mournfully addressing the
queen but the king waved his arm severely and men and women with bare
legs came in from both sides and began dancing all together then the
violins played very shrilly and merrily and one of the women with thick
bare legs and thin arms separating from the others went behind the
wings adjusted her bodice returned to the middle of the stage and
began jumping and striking one foot rapidly against the other in the
stalls everyone clapped and shouted bravo then one of the men
went into a corner of the stage the cymbals and horns in the orchestra
struck up more loudly and this man with bare legs jumped very high and
waved his feet about very rapidly he was duport who received sixty
thousand rubles a year for this art everybody in the stalls boxes 
and galleries began clapping and shouting with all their might and the
man stopped and began smiling and bowing to all sides then other men
and women danced with bare legs then the king again shouted to the
sound of music and they all began singing but suddenly a storm
came on chromatic scales and diminished sevenths were heard in the
orchestra everyone ran off again dragging one of their number away 
and the curtain dropped once more there was a terrible noise and
clatter among the audience and with rapturous faces everyone began
shouting duport duport duport nat sha no longer thought this
strange she looked about with pleasure smiling joyfully 

 isn t duport delightful h l ne asked her 

 oh yes replied nat sha 





chapter x

during the entr acte a whiff of cold air came into h l ne s box 
the door opened and anatole entered stooping and trying not to brush
against anyone 

 let me introduce my brother to you said h l ne her eyes
shifting uneasily from nat sha to anatole 

nat sha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young officer
and smiled at him over her bare shoulder anatole who was as handsome
at close quarters as at a distance sat down beside her and told her he
had long wished to have this happiness ever since the nar shkins 
ball in fact at which he had had the well remembered pleasure of seeing
her kur gin was much more sensible and simple with women than among
men he talked boldly and naturally and nat sha was strangely and
agreeably struck by the fact that there was nothing formidable in this
man about whom there was so much talk but that on the contrary his
smile was most na ve cheerful and good natured 

kur gin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a
previous performance sem nova had fallen down on the stage 

 and do you know countess he said suddenly addressing her as an
old familiar acquaintance we are getting up a costume tournament 
you ought to take part in it it will be great fun we shall all meet at
the kar gins please come no really eh said he 

while saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face 
her neck and her bare arms nat sha knew for certain that he was
enraptured by her this pleased her yet his presence made her feel
constrained and oppressed when she was not looking at him she felt that
he was looking at her shoulders and she involuntarily caught his eye
so that he should look into hers rather than this but looking into his
eyes she was frightened realizing that there was not that barrier of
modesty she had always felt between herself and other men she did not
know how it was that within five minutes she had come to feel herself
terribly near to this man when she turned away she feared he might
seize her from behind by her bare arm and kiss her on the neck they
spoke of most ordinary things yet she felt that they were closer to
one another than she had ever been to any man nat sha kept turning to
h l ne and to her father as if asking what it all meant but h l ne
was engaged in conversation with a general and did not answer her
look and her father s eyes said nothing but what they always said 
 having a good time well i m glad of it 

during one of these moments of awkward silence when anatole s
prominent eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her nat sha to break
the silence asked him how he liked moscow she asked the question and
blushed she felt all the time that by talking to him she was doing
something improper anatole smiled as though to encourage her 

 at first i did not like it much because what makes a town pleasant
ce sont les jolies femmes isn t that so but now i like it very
much indeed he said looking at her significantly you ll come
to the costume tournament countess do come and putting out his
hand to her bouquet and dropping his voice he added you will be the
prettiest there do come dear countess and give me this flower as a
pledge 

 are the pretty women 

nat sha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did
himself but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improper
intention she did not know what to say and turned away as if she had
not heard his remark but as soon as she had turned away she felt that
he was there behind so close behind her 

 how is he now confused angry ought i to put it right she
asked herself and she could not refrain from turning round she looked
straight into his eyes and his nearness self assurance and the
good natured tenderness of his smile vanquished her she smiled just
as he was doing gazing straight into his eyes and again she felt with
horror that no barrier lay between him and her 

the curtain rose again anatole left the box serene and gay nat sha
went back to her father in the other box now quite submissive to the
world she found herself in all that was going on before her now seemed
quite natural but on the other hand all her previous thoughts of her
betrothed of princess mary or of life in the country did not once
recur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote past 

in the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his arm
about till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he disappeared
down below that was the only part of the fourth act that nat sha saw 
she felt agitated and tormented and the cause of this was kur gin whom
she could not help watching as they were leaving the theater anatole
came up to them called their carriage and helped them in as he was
putting nat sha in he pressed her arm above the elbow agitated and
flushed she turned round he was looking at her with glittering eyes 
smiling tenderly 


only after she had reached home was nat sha able clearly to think over
what had happened to her and suddenly remembering prince andrew she
was horrified and at tea to which all had sat down after the opera she
gave a loud exclamation flushed and ran out of the room 

 o god i am lost she said to herself how could i let him 
she sat for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to
realize what had happened to her but was unable either to understand
what had happened or what she felt everything seemed dark obscure 
and terrible there in that enormous illuminated theater where the
bare legged duport in a tinsel decorated jacket jumped about to the
music on wet boards and young girls and old men and the nearly
naked h l ne with her proud calm smile rapturously cried
 bravo there in the presence of that h l ne it had all seemed
clear and simple but now alone by herself it was incomprehensible 
 what is it what was that terror i felt of him what is this gnawing
of conscience i am feeling now she thought 

only to the old countess at night in bed could nat sha have told all
she was feeling she knew that s nya with her severe and simple views
would either not understand it at all or would be horrified at such
a confession so nat sha tried to solve what was torturing her by
herself 

 am i spoiled for andrew s love or not she asked herself and
with soothing irony replied what a fool i am to ask that what did
happen to me nothing i have done nothing i didn t lead him on
at all nobody will know and i shall never see him again she told
herself so it is plain that nothing has happened and there is
nothing to repent of and andrew can love me still but why still 
o god why isn t he here nat sha quieted herself for a moment 
but again some instinct told her that though all this was true and
though nothing had happened yet the former purity of her love for
prince andrew had perished and again in imagination she went over her
whole conversation with kur gin and again saw the face gestures and
tender smile of that bold handsome man when he pressed her arm 





chapter xi

anatole kur gin was staying in moscow because his father had sent him
away from petersburg where he had been spending twenty thousand rubles
a year in cash besides running up debts for as much more which his
creditors demanded from his father 

his father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for the
last time but only on condition that he went to moscow as adjutant to
the commander in chief a post his father had procured for him and
would at last try to make a good match there he indicated to him
princess mary and julie kar gina 

anatole consented and went to moscow where he put up at pierre s
house pierre received him unwillingly at first but got used to him
after a while sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals and gave
him money under the guise of loans 

as shinsh n had remarked from the time of his arrival anatole had
turned the heads of the moscow ladies especially by the fact that
he slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and french
actresses with the chief of whom mademoiselle george he was said to
be on intimate relations he had never missed a carousal at dan lov s
or other moscow revelers drank whole nights through outvying
everyone else and was at all the balls and parties of the best society 
there was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies and he flirted
with a few of them at the balls but he did not run after the unmarried
girls especially the rich heiresses who were most of them plain 
there was a special reason for this as he had got married two years
before a fact known only to his most intimate friends at that time
while with his regiment in poland a polish landowner of small means had
forced him to marry his daughter anatole had very soon abandoned his
wife and for a payment which he agreed to send to his father in law 
had arranged to be free to pass himself off as a bachelor 

anatole was always content with his position with himself and with
others he was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that it was
impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had
never in his life done anything base he was incapable of considering
how his actions might affect others or what the consequences of this or
that action of his might be he was convinced that as a duck is so made
that it must live in water so god had made him such that he must spend
thirty thousand rubles a year and always occupy a prominent position in
society he believed this so firmly that others looking at him were
persuaded of it too and did not refuse him either a leading place
in society or money which he borrowed from anyone and everyone and
evidently would not repay 

he was not a gambler at any rate he did not care about winning he was
not vain he did not mind what people thought of him still less could
he be accused of ambition more than once he had vexed his father by
spoiling his own career and he laughed at distinctions of all kinds he
was not mean and did not refuse anyone who asked of him all he cared
about was gaiety and women and as according to his ideas there
was nothing dishonorable in these tastes and he was incapable of
considering what the gratification of his tastes entailed for others 
he honestly considered himself irreproachable sincerely despised rogues
and bad people and with a tranquil conscience carried his head high 

rakes those male magdalenes have a secret feeling of innocence
similar to that which female magdalenes have based on the same hope of
forgiveness all will be forgiven her for she loved much and all
will be forgiven him for he enjoyed much 

d lokhov who had reappeared that year in moscow after his exile and
his persian adventures and was leading a life of luxury gambling and
dissipation associated with his old petersburg comrade kur gin and
made use of him for his own ends 

anatole was sincerely fond of d lokhov for his cleverness and
audacity d lokhov who needed anatole kur gin s name position and
connections as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set made
use of him and amused himself at his expense without letting the other
feel it apart from the advantage he derived from anatole the very
process of dominating another s will was in itself a pleasure a
habit and a necessity to d lokhov 

nat sha had made a strong impression on kur gin at supper after
the opera he described to d lokhov with the air of a connoisseur the
attractions of her arms shoulders feet and hair and expressed his
intention of making love to her anatole had no notion and was incapable
of considering what might come of such love making as he never had any
notion of the outcome of any of his actions 

 she s first rate my dear fellow but not for us replied
d lokhov 

 i will tell my sister to ask her to dinner said anatole 
 eh 

 you d better wait till she s married 

 you know i adore little girls they lose their heads at once 
pursued anatole 

 you have been caught once already by a little girl said
d lokhov who knew of kur gin s marriage take care 

 well that can t happen twice eh said anatole with a
good humored laugh 





chapter xii

the day after the opera the rost vs went nowhere and nobody came to see
them m rya dm trievna talked to the count about something which they
concealed from nat sha nat sha guessed they were talking about the
old prince and planning something and this disquieted and offended her 
she was expecting prince andrew any moment and twice that day sent a
manservant to the vozdv zhenka to ascertain whether he had come he had
not arrived she suffered more now than during her first days in moscow 
to her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant
recollection of her interview with princess mary and the old prince 
and a fear and anxiety of which she did not understand the cause she
continually fancied that either he would never come or that something
would happen to her before he came she could no longer think of him by
herself calmly and continuously as she had done before as soon as she
began to think of him the recollection of the old prince of princess
mary of the theater and of kur gin mingled with her thoughts the
question again presented itself whether she was not guilty whether she
had not already broken faith with prince andrew and again she found
herself recalling to the minutest detail every word every gesture and
every shade in the play of expression on the face of the man who had
been able to arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying
feeling to the family nat sha seemed livelier than usual but she was
far less tranquil and happy than before 

on sunday morning m rya dm trievna invited her visitors to mass at her
parish church the church of the assumption built over the graves of
victims of the plague 

 i don t like those fashionable churches she said evidently
priding herself on her independence of thought god is the same
everywhere we have an excellent priest he conducts the service
decently and with dignity and the deacon is the same what holiness is
there in giving concerts in the choir i don t like it it s just
self indulgence 

m rya dm trievna liked sundays and knew how to keep them her whole
house was scrubbed and cleaned on saturdays neither she nor the
servants worked and they all wore holiday dress and went to church at
her table there were extra dishes at dinner and the servants had vodka
and roast goose or suckling pig but in nothing in the house was the
holiday so noticeable as in m rya dm trievna s broad stern face 
which on that day wore an invariable look of solemn festivity 

after mass when they had finished their coffee in the dining room
where the loose covers had been removed from the furniture a servant
announced that the carriage was ready and m rya dm trievna rose with
a stern air she wore her holiday shawl in which she paid calls and
announced that she was going to see prince nicholas bolk nski to have
an explanation with him about nat sha 

after she had gone a dressmaker from madame suppert roguet waited on
the rost vs and nat sha very glad of this diversion having shut
herself into a room adjoining the drawing room occupied herself trying
on the new dresses just as she had put on a bodice without sleeves and
only tacked together and was turning her head to see in the glass how
the back fitted she heard in the drawing room the animated sounds
of her father s voice and another s a woman s that made her
flush it was h l ne nat sha had not time to take off the bodice
before the door opened and countess bez khova dressed in a purple
velvet gown with a high collar came into the room beaming with
good humored amiable smiles 

 oh my enchantress she cried to the blushing nat sha 
 charming no this is really beyond anything my dear count said
she to count rost v who had followed her in how can you live in
moscow and go nowhere no i won t let you off mademoiselle george
will recite at my house tonight and there ll be some people and if
you don t bring your lovely girls who are prettier than mademoiselle
george i won t know you my husband is away in tver or i would send
him to fetch you you must come you positively must between eight and
nine 

she nodded to the dressmaker whom she knew and who had curtsied
respectfully to her and seated herself in an armchair beside the
looking glass draping the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely she
did not cease chattering good naturedly and gaily continually praising
nat sha s beauty she looked at nat sha s dresses and praised
them as well as a new dress of her own made of metallic gauze 
which she had received from paris and advised nat sha to have one like
it 

 but anything suits you my charmer she remarked 

a smile of pleasure never left nat sha s face she felt happy and as
if she were blossoming under the praise of this dear countess bez khova
who had formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and important and was
now so kind to her nat sha brightened up and felt almost in love with
this woman who was so beautiful and so kind h l ne for her part was
sincerely delighted with nat sha and wished to give her a good time 
anatole had asked her to bring him and nat sha together and she was
calling on the rost vs for that purpose the idea of throwing her
brother and nat sha together amused her 

though at one time in petersburg she had been annoyed with nat sha
for drawing bor s away she did not think of that now and in her own
way heartily wished nat sha well as she was leaving the rost vs she
called her prot g e aside 

 my brother dined with me yesterday we nearly died of laughter he
ate nothing and kept sighing for you my charmer he is madly quite
madly in love with you my dear 

nat sha blushed scarlet when she heard this 

 how she blushes how she blushes my pretty said h l ne you
must certainly come if you love somebody my charmer that is not a
reason to shut yourself up even if you are engaged i am sure your
fianc would wish you to go into society rather than be bored to
death 

 so she knows i am engaged and she and her husband pierre that good
pierre have talked and laughed about this so it s all right and
again under h l ne s influence what had seemed terrible now seemed
simple and natural and she is such a grande dame so kind and
evidently likes me so much and why not enjoy myself thought
nat sha gazing at h l ne with wide open wondering eyes 

m rya dm trievna came back to dinner taciturn and serious having
evidently suffered a defeat at the old prince s she was still too
agitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the affair calmly in
answer to the count s inquiries she replied that things were all
right and that she would tell about it next day on hearing of countess
bez khova s visit and the invitation for that evening m rya
dm trievna remarked 

 i don t care to have anything to do with bez khova and don t
advise you to however if you ve promised go it will divert your
thoughts she added addressing nat sha 





chapter xiii

count rost v took the girls to countess bez khova s there were
a good many people there but nearly all strangers to nat sha count
rost v was displeased to see that the company consisted almost entirely
of men and women known for the freedom of their conduct mademoiselle
george was standing in a corner of the drawing room surrounded by young
men there were several frenchmen present among them m tivier who from
the time h l ne reached moscow had been an intimate in her house the
count decided not to sit down to cards or let his girls out of his sight
and to get away as soon as mademoiselle george s performance was over 

anatole was at the door evidently on the lookout for the rost vs 
immediately after greeting the count he went up to nat sha and followed
her as soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feeling she had
had at the opera gratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear at
the absence of a moral barrier between them 

h l ne welcomed nat sha delightedly and was loud in admiration of her
beauty and her dress soon after their arrival mademoiselle george went
out of the room to change her costume in the drawing room people began
arranging the chairs and taking their seats anatole moved a chair for
nat sha and was about to sit down beside her but the count who never
lost sight of her took the seat himself anatole sat down behind her 

mademoiselle george with her bare fat dimpled arms and a red shawl
draped over one shoulder came into the space left vacant for her and
assumed an unnatural pose enthusiastic whispering was audible 

mademoiselle george looked sternly and gloomily at the audience and
began reciting some french verses describing her guilty love for her
son in some places she raised her voice in others she whispered 
lifting her head triumphantly sometimes she paused and uttered hoarse
sounds rolling her eyes 

 adorable divine delicious was heard from every side 

nat sha looked at the fat actress but neither saw nor heard nor
understood anything of what went on before her she only felt herself
again completely borne away into this strange senseless world so
remote from her old world a world in which it was impossible to know
what was good or bad reasonable or senseless behind her sat anatole 
and conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense of
expectancy 

after the first monologue the whole company rose and surrounded
mademoiselle george expressing their enthusiasm 

 how beautiful she is nat sha remarked to her father who had also
risen and was moving through the crowd toward the actress 

 i don t think so when i look at you said anatole following
nat sha he said this at a moment when she alone could hear him you
are enchanting from the moment i saw you i have never ceased 

 come come nat sha said the count as he turned back for his
daughter how beautiful she is nat sha without saying anything
stepped up to her father and looked at him with surprised inquiring
eyes 

after giving several recitations mademoiselle george left and countess
bez khova asked her visitors into the ballroom 

the count wished to go home but h l ne entreated him not to spoil her
improvised ball and the rost vs stayed on anatole asked nat sha for
a valse and as they danced he pressed her waist and hand and told her
she was bewitching and that he loved her during the cossaise which
she also danced with him anatole said nothing when they happened to be
by themselves but merely gazed at her nat sha lifted her frightened
eyes to him but there was such confident tenderness in his affectionate
look and smile that she could not whilst looking at him say what she
had to say she lowered her eyes 

 don t say such things to me i am betrothed and love another 
she said rapidly she glanced at him 

anatole was not upset or pained by what she had said 

 don t speak to me of that what can i do said he i tell
you i am madly madly in love with you is it my fault that you are
enchanting it s our turn to begin 

nat sha animated and excited looked about her with wide open
frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual she understood hardly
anything that went on that evening they danced the cossaise and the
grossvater her father asked her to come home but she begged to remain 
wherever she went and whomever she was speaking to she felt his eyes
upon her later on she recalled how she had asked her father to let
her go to the dressing room to rearrange her dress that h l ne had
followed her and spoken laughingly of her brother s love and that she
again met anatole in the little sitting room h l ne had disappeared
leaving them alone and anatole had taken her hand and said in a tender
voice 

 i cannot come to visit you but is it possible that i shall never see
you i love you madly can i never and blocking her path he
brought his face close to hers 

his large glittering masculine eyes were so close to hers that she saw
nothing but them 

 natalie he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being
painfully pressed natalie 

 i don t understand i have nothing to say her eyes replied 

burning lips were pressed to hers and at the same instant she felt
herself released and h l ne s footsteps and the rustle of her dress
were heard in the room nat sha looked round at her and then red
and trembling threw a frightened look of inquiry at anatole and moved
toward the door 

 one word just one for god s sake cried anatole 

she paused she so wanted a word from him that would explain to her what
had happened and to which she could find no answer 

 natalie just a word only one he kept repeating evidently not
knowing what to say and he repeated it till h l ne came up to them 

h l ne returned with nat sha to the drawing room the rost vs went
away without staying for supper 

after reaching home nat sha did not sleep all night she was tormented
by the insoluble question whether she loved anatole or prince andrew 
she loved prince andrew she remembered distinctly how deeply she loved
him but she also loved anatole of that there was no doubt else how
could all this have happened thought she if after that i could
return his smile when saying good by if i was able to let it come to
that it means that i loved him from the first it means that he is
kind noble and splendid and i could not help loving him what am i to
do if i love him and the other one too she asked herself unable to
find an answer to these terrible questions 





chapter xiv

morning came with its cares and bustle everyone got up and began
to move about and talk dressmakers came again m rya dm trievna
appeared and they were called to breakfast nat sha kept looking
uneasily at everybody with wide open eyes as if wishing to intercept
every glance directed toward her and tried to appear the same as usual 

after breakfast which was her best time m rya dm trievna sat down in
her armchair and called nat sha and the count to her 

 well friends i have now thought the whole matter over and this is
my advice she began yesterday as you know i went to see prince
bolk nski well i had a talk with him he took it into his head to
begin shouting but i am not one to be shouted down i said what i had
to say 

 well and he asked the count 

 he he s crazy he did not want to listen but what s the use
of talking as it is we have worn the poor girl out said m rya
dm trievna my advice to you is finish your business and go back
home to otr dnoe and wait there 

 oh no exclaimed nat sha 

 yes go back said m rya dm trievna and wait there if your
betrothed comes here now there will be no avoiding a quarrel but
alone with the old man he will talk things over and then come on to
you 

count rost v approved of this suggestion appreciating its
reasonableness if the old man came round it would be all the better to
visit him in moscow or at bald hills later on and if not the wedding 
against his wishes could only be arranged at otr dnoe 

 that is perfectly true and i am sorry i went to see him and took
her said the old count 

 no why be sorry being here you had to pay your respects but if he
won t that s his affair said m rya dm trievna looking for
something in her reticule besides the trousseau is ready so there
is nothing to wait for and what is not ready i ll send after you 
though i don t like letting you go it is the best way so go with
god s blessing 

having found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it to
nat sha it was a letter from princess mary 

 she has written to you how she torments herself poor thing she s
afraid you might think that she does not like you 

 but she doesn t like me said nat sha 

 don t talk nonsense cried m rya dm trievna 

 i shan t believe anyone i know she doesn t like me replied
nat sha boldly as she took the letter and her face expressed a cold
and angry resolution that caused m rya dm trievna to look at her more
intently and to frown 

 don t answer like that my good girl she said what i say is
true write an answer 

nat sha did not reply and went to her own room to read princess
mary s letter 

princess mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding that
had occurred between them whatever her father s feelings might be 
she begged nat sha to believe that she could not help loving her as
the one chosen by her brother for whose happiness she was ready to
sacrifice everything 

 do not think however she wrote that my father is
ill disposed toward you he is an invalid and an old man who must be
forgiven but he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his
son happy princess mary went on to ask nat sha to fix a time when
she could see her again 

after reading the letter nat sha sat down at the writing table
to answer it dear princess she wrote in french quickly and
mechanically and then paused what more could she write after all that
had happened the evening before yes yes all that has happened and
now all is changed she thought as she sat with the letter she had
begun before her must i break off with him must i really that s
awful and to escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to
s nya and began sorting patterns with her 

after dinner nat sha went to her room and again took up princess
mary s letter can it be that it is all over she thought 
 can it be that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all
that went before she recalled her love for prince andrew in all its
former strength and at the same time felt that she loved kur gin she
vividly pictured herself as prince andrew s wife and the scenes of
happiness with him she had so often repeated in her imagination and
at the same time aglow with excitement recalled every detail of
yesterday s interview with anatole 

 why could that not be as well she sometimes asked herself in
complete bewilderment only so could i be completely happy but now i
have to choose and i can t be happy without either of them only 
she thought to tell prince andrew what has happened or to hide
it from him are both equally impossible but with that one nothing is
spoiled but am i really to abandon forever the joy of prince andrew s
love in which i have lived so long 

 please miss whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious
air a man told me to give you this and she handed nat sha a
letter 

 only for christ s sake the girl went on as nat sha 
without thinking mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter
from anatole of which without taking in a word she understood only
that it was a letter from him from the man she loved yes she loved
him or else how could that have happened which had happened and how
could she have a love letter from him in her hand 

with trembling hands nat sha held that passionate love letter which
d lokhov had composed for anatole and as she read it she found in it
an echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling 

 since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed to be loved by you
or to die there is no other way for me the letter began then he
went on to say that he knew her parents would not give her to him for
this there were secret reasons he could reveal only to her but that if
she loved him she need only say the word yes and no human power could
hinder their bliss love would conquer all he would steal her away and
carry her off to the ends of the earth 

 yes yes i love him thought nat sha reading the letter for the
twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of
it 

that evening m rya dm trievna was going to the akh rovs and
proposed to take the girls with her nat sha pleading a headache 
remained at home 





chapter xv

on returning late in the evening s nya went to nat sha s room and
to her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa open on
the table beside her lay anatole s letter s nya picked it up and
read it 

as she read she glanced at the sleeping nat sha trying to find in her
face an explanation of what she was reading but did not find it her
face was calm gentle and happy clutching her breast to keep herself
from choking s nya pale and trembling with fear and agitation sat
down in an armchair and burst into tears 

 how was it i noticed nothing how could it go so far can she have
left off loving prince andrew and how could she let kur gin go to
such lengths he is a deceiver and a villain that s plain what will
nicholas dear noble nicholas do when he hears of it so this is
the meaning of her excited resolute unnatural look the day before
yesterday yesterday and today thought s nya but it can t be
that she loves him she probably opened the letter without knowing who
it was from probably she is offended by it she could not do such a
thing 

s nya wiped away her tears and went up to nat sha again scanning her
face 

 nat sha she said just audibly 

nat sha awoke and saw s nya 

 ah you re back 

and with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment of
awakening she embraced her friend but noticing s nya s look of
embarrassment her own face expressed confusion and suspicion 

 s nya you ve read that letter she demanded 

 yes answered s nya softly 

nat sha smiled rapturously 

 no s nya i can t any longer she said i can t hide it
from you any longer you know we love one another s nya darling he
writes s nya 

s nya stared open eyed at nat sha unable to believe her ears 

 and bolk nski she asked 

 ah s nya if you only knew how happy i am cried nat sha 
 you don t know what love is 

 but nat sha can that be all over 

nat sha looked at s nya with wide open eyes as if she could not grasp
the question 

 well then are you refusing prince andrew said s nya 

 oh you don t understand anything don t talk nonsense just
listen said nat sha with momentary vexation 

 but i can t believe it insisted s nya i don t
understand how is it you have loved a man for a whole year and
suddenly why you have only seen him three times nat sha i don t
believe you you re joking in three days to forget everything and
so 

 three days said nat sha it seems to me i ve loved him a
hundred years it seems to me that i have never loved anyone before you
can t understand it s nya wait a bit sit here and nat sha
embraced and kissed her 

 i had heard that it happens like this and you must have heard it
too but it s only now that i feel such love it s not the same as
before as soon as i saw him i felt he was my master and i his slave 
and that i could not help loving him yes his slave whatever he orders
i shall do you don t understand that what can i do what can i do 
s nya cried nat sha with a happy yet frightened expression 

 but think what you are doing cried s nya i can t leave
it like this this secret correspondence how could you let him go so
far she went on with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal 

 i told you that i have no will nat sha replied why can t
you understand i love him 

 then i won t let it come to that i shall tell cried s nya 
bursting into tears 

 what do you mean for god s sake if you tell you are my
enemy declared nat sha you want me to be miserable you want us
to be separated 

when she saw nat sha s fright s nya shed tears of shame and pity
for her friend 

 but what has happened between you she asked what has he said
to you why doesn t he come to the house 

nat sha did not answer her questions 

 for god s sake s nya don t tell anyone don t torture
me nat sha entreated remember no one ought to interfere in such
matters i have confided in you 

 but why this secrecy why doesn t he come to the house asked
s nya why doesn t he openly ask for your hand you know prince
andrew gave you complete freedom if it is really so but i don t
believe it nat sha have you considered what these secret reasons can
be 

nat sha looked at s nya with astonishment evidently this question
presented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how
to answer it 

 i don t know what the reasons are but there must be reasons 

s nya sighed and shook her head incredulously 

 if there were reasons she began 

but nat sha guessing her doubts interrupted her in alarm 

 s nya one can t doubt him one can t one can t don t you
understand she cried 

 does he love you 

 does he love me nat sha repeated with a smile of pity at her
friend s lack of comprehension why you have read his letter and
you have seen him 

 but if he is dishonorable 

 he dishonorable if you only knew exclaimed nat sha 

 if he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions or
cease seeing you and if you won t do this i will i will write to
him and i will tell papa said s nya resolutely 

 but i can t live without him cried nat sha 

 nat sha i don t understand you and what are you saying think of
your father and of nicholas 

 i don t want anyone i don t love anyone but him how dare you
say he is dishonorable don t you know that i love him screamed
nat sha go away s nya i don t want to quarrel with you but
go for god s sake go you see how i am suffering nat sha cried
angrily in a voice of despair and repressed irritation s nya burst
into sobs and ran from the room 

nat sha went to the table and without a moment s reflection wrote
that answer to princess mary which she had been unable to write all
the morning in this letter she said briefly that all their
misunderstandings were at an end that availing herself of the
magnanimity of prince andrew who when he went abroad had given her her
freedom she begged princess mary to forget everything and forgive her
if she had been to blame toward her but that she could not be his
wife at that moment this all seemed quite easy simple and clear to
nat sha 


on friday the rost vs were to return to the country but on wednesday
the count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near moscow 

on the day the count left s nya and nat sha were invited to a big
dinner party at the kar gins and m rya dm trievna took them
there at that party nat sha again met anatole and s nya noticed
that she spoke to him trying not to be overheard and that all through
dinner she was more agitated than ever when they got home nat sha was
the first to begin the explanation s nya expected 

 there s nya you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him 
nat sha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be
praised we have had an explanation today 

 well what happened what did he say nat sha how glad i am
you re not angry with me tell me everything the whole truth what
did he say 

nat sha became thoughtful 

 oh s nya if you knew him as i do he said he asked me what i
had promised bolk nski he was glad i was free to refuse him 

s nya sighed sorrowfully 

 but you haven t refused bolk nski said she 

 perhaps i have perhaps all is over between me and bolk nski why do
you think so badly of me 

 i don t think anything only i don t understand this 

 wait a bit s nya you ll understand everything you ll see what
a man he is now don t think badly of me or of him i don t think
badly of anyone i love and pity everybody but what am i to do 

s nya did not succumb to the tender tone nat sha used toward her 
the more emotional and ingratiating the expression of nat sha s face
became the more serious and stern grew s nya s 

 nat sha said she you asked me not to speak to you and i
haven t spoken but now you yourself have begun i don t trust him 
nat sha why this secrecy 

 again again interrupted nat sha 

 nat sha i am afraid for you 

 afraid of what 

 i am afraid you re going to your ruin said s nya resolutely 
and was herself horrified at what she had said 

anger again showed in nat sha s face 

 and i ll go to my ruin i will as soon as possible it s not
your business it won t be you but i who ll suffer leave me
alone leave me alone i hate you 

 nat sha moaned s nya aghast 

 i hate you i hate you you re my enemy forever and nat sha
ran out of the room 

nat sha did not speak to s nya again and avoided her with the same
expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house 
taking up now one occupation now another and at once abandoning them 

hard as it was for s nya she watched her friend and did not let her
out of her sight 

the day before the count was to return s nya noticed that nat sha sat
by the drawing room window all the morning as if expecting something and
that she made a sign to an officer who drove past whom s nya took to
be anatole 

s nya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that
at dinner and all that evening nat sha was in a strange and unnatural
state she answered questions at random began sentences she did not
finish and laughed at everything 

after tea s nya noticed a housemaid at nat sha s door timidly
waiting to let her pass she let the girl go in and then listening at
the door learned that another letter had been delivered 

then suddenly it became clear to s nya that nat sha had some dreadful
plan for that evening s nya knocked at her door nat sha did not let
her in 

 she will run away with him thought s nya she is capable of
anything there was something particularly pathetic and resolute in
her face today she cried as she said good by to uncle s nya
remembered yes that s it she means to elope with him but
what am i to do thought she recalling all the signs that clearly
indicated that nat sha had some terrible intention the count is
away what am i to do write to kur gin demanding an explanation but
what is there to oblige him to reply write to pierre as prince andrew
asked me to in case of some misfortune but perhaps she really
has already refused bolk nski she sent a letter to princess mary
yesterday and uncle is away to tell m rya dm trievna who had
such faith in nat sha seemed to s nya terrible well anyway 
thought s nya as she stood in the dark passage now or never i must
prove that i remember the family s goodness to me and that i love
nicholas yes if i don t sleep for three nights i ll not leave this
passage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the family
be disgraced thought she 





chapter xvi

anatole had lately moved to d lokhov s the plan for natalie
rost va s abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by
d lokhov a few days before and on the day that s nya after listening
at nat sha s door resolved to safeguard her it was to have been
put into execution nat sha had promised to come out to kur gin at the
back porch at ten that evening kur gin was to put her into a troyka
he would have ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of
k menka where an unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a
marriage ceremony over them at k menka a relay of horses was to wait
which would take them to the warsaw highroad and from there they would
hasten abroad with post horses 

anatole had a passport an order for post horses ten thousand rubles
he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with
d lokhov s help 

two witnesses for the mock marriage khv stikov a retired petty
official whom d lokhov made use of in his gambling transactions and
mak rin a retired hussar a kindly weak fellow who had an unbounded
affection for kur gin were sitting at tea in d lokhov s front
room 

in his large study the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with
persian rugs bearskins and weapons sat d lokhov in a traveling cloak
and high boots at an open desk on which lay an abacus and some bundles
of paper money anatole with uniform unbuttoned walked to and fro from
the room where the witnesses were sitting through the study to the room
behind where his french valet and others were packing the last of his
things d lokhov was counting the money and noting something down 

 well he said khv stikov must have two thousand 

 give it to him then said anatole 

 mak rka their name for mak rin will go through fire and
water for you for nothing so here are our accounts all settled said
d lokhov showing him the memorandum is that right 

 yes of course returned anatole evidently not listening to
d lokhov and looking straight before him with a smile that did not
leave his face 

d lokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to anatole with an
ironic smile 

 do you know you d really better drop it all there s still
time 

 fool retorted anatole don t talk nonsense if you only
knew it s the devil knows what 

 no really give it up said d lokhov i am speaking
seriously it s no joke this plot you ve hatched 

 what teasing again go to the devil eh said anatole making a
grimace really it s no time for your stupid jokes and he left
the room 

d lokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when anatole had
gone out 

 you wait a bit he called after him i m not joking i m
talking sense come here come here 

anatole returned and looked at d lokhov trying to give him his
attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily 

 now listen to me i m telling you this for the last time why
should i joke about it did i hinder you who arranged everything for
you who found the priest and got the passport who raised the money i
did it all 

 well thank you for it do you think i am not grateful and
anatole sighed and embraced d lokhov 

 i helped you but all the same i must tell you the truth it is a
dangerous business and if you think about it a stupid business well 
you ll carry her off all right will they let it stop at that it
will come out that you re already married why they ll have you in
the criminal court 

 oh nonsense nonsense anatole ejaculated and again made a
grimace didn t i explain to you what and anatole with the
partiality dull witted people have for any conclusion they have reached
by their own reasoning repeated the argument he had already put to
d lokhov a hundred times didn t i explain to you that i have come
to this conclusion if this marriage is invalid he went on crooking
one finger then i have nothing to answer for but if it is valid no
matter abroad no one will know anything about it isn t that so and
don t talk to me don t don t 

 seriously you d better drop it you ll only get yourself into a
mess 

 go to the devil cried anatole and clutching his hair left the
room but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of
d lokhov with his feet turned under him it s the very devil 
what feel how it beats he took d lokhov s hand and put it on his
heart what a foot my dear fellow what a glance a goddess he
added in french what 

d lokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes
looked at him evidently wishing to get some more amusement out of him 

 well and when the money s gone what then 

 what then eh repeated anatole sincerely perplexed by a thought
of the future what then then i don t know but why talk
nonsense he glanced at his watch it s time 

anatole went into the back room 

 now then nearly ready you re dawdling he shouted to the
servants 

d lokhov put away the money called a footman whom he ordered to bring
something for them to eat and drink before the journey and went into
the room where khv stikov and mak rin were sitting 

anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling
pensively while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself 

 come and eat something have a drink d lokhov shouted to him
from the other room 

 i don t want to answered anatole continuing to smile 

 come balag is here 

anatole rose and went into the dining room balag was a famous troyka
driver who had known d lokhov and anatole some six years and had given
them good service with his troykas more than once when anatole s
regiment was stationed at tver he had taken him from tver in the
evening brought him to moscow by daybreak and driven him back again
the next night more than once he had enabled d lokhov to escape when
pursued more than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies
and ladykins as he called the cocottes more than once in their
service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets
of moscow and had always been protected from the consequences by my
gentlemen as he called them he had ruined more than one horse in
their service more than once they had beaten him and more than once
they had made him drunk on champagne and madeira which he loved and
he knew more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have
sent an ordinary man to siberia they often called balag into their
orgies and made him drink and dance at the gypsies and more than one
thousand rubles of their money had passed through his hands in their
service he risked his skin and his life twenty times a year and in
their service had lost more horses than the money he had from them would
buy but he liked them liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour 
liked upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian and flying at
full gallop through the moscow streets he liked to hear those wild 
tipsy shouts behind him get on get on when it was impossible
to go any faster he liked giving a painful lash on the neck to some
peasant who more dead than alive was already hurrying out of his way 
 real gentlemen he considered them 

anatole and d lokhov liked balag too for his masterly driving and
because he liked the things they liked with others balag bargained 
charging twenty five rubles for a two hours drive and rarely
drove himself generally letting his young men do so but with his
gentlemen he always drove himself and never demanded anything for
his work only a couple of times a year when he knew from their valets
that they had money in hand he would turn up of a morning quite sober
and with a deep bow would ask them to help him the gentlemen always
made him sit down 

 do help me out theodore iv nych sir or your excellency 
he would say i am quite out of horses let me have what you can to
go to the fair 

and anatole and d lokhov when they had money would give him a
thousand or a couple of thousand rubles 

balag was a fair haired short and snub nosed peasant of about
twenty seven red faced with a particularly red thick neck glittering
little eyes and a small beard he wore a fine dark blue silk lined
cloth coat over a sheepskin 

on entering the room now he crossed himself turning toward the front
corner of the room and went up to d lokhov holding out a small black
hand 

 theodore iv nych he said bowing 

 how d you do friend well here he is 

 good day your excellency he said again holding out his hand to
anatole who had just come in 

 i say balag said anatole putting his hands on the man s
shoulders do you care for me or not eh now do me a service 
what horses have you come with eh 

 as your messenger ordered your special beasts replied balag 

 well listen balag drive all three to death but get me there in
three hours eh 

 when they are dead what shall i drive said balag with a wink 

 mind i ll smash your face in don t make jokes cried
anatole suddenly rolling his eyes 

 why joke said the driver laughing as if i d grudge my
gentlemen anything as fast as ever the horses can gallop so fast
we ll go 

 ah said anatole well sit down 

 yes sit down said d lokhov 

 i ll stand theodore iv nych 

 sit down nonsense have a drink said anatole and filled a large
glass of madeira for him 

the driver s eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine after refusing
it for manners sake he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk
handkerchief he took out of his cap 

 and when are we to start your excellency 

 well anatole looked at his watch we ll start at once 
mind balag you ll get there in time eh 

 that depends on our luck in starting else why shouldn t we be
there in time replied balag didn t we get you to tver in
seven hours i think you remember that your excellency 

 do you know one christmas i drove from tver said anatole 
smilingly at the recollection and turning to mak rin who gazed
rapturously at him with wide open eyes will you believe it 
mak rka it took one s breath away the rate we flew we came across
a train of loaded sleighs and drove right over two of them eh 

 those were horses balag continued the tale that time i d
harnessed two young side horses with the bay in the shafts he went
on turning to d lokhov will you believe it theodore iv nych 
those animals flew forty miles i couldn t hold them in my hands grew
numb in the sharp frost so that i threw down the reins catch hold
yourself your excellency says i and i just tumbled on the bottom
of the sleigh and sprawled there it wasn t a case of urging them on 
there was no holding them in till we reached the place the devils took
us there in three hours only the near one died of it 





chapter xvii

anatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later wearing
a fur coat girt with a silver belt and a sable cap jauntily set on one
side and very becoming to his handsome face having looked in a mirror 
and standing before d lokhov in the same pose he had assumed before it 
he lifted a glass of wine 

 well good by theodore thank you for everything and farewell said
anatole well comrades and friends he considered for a moment 
of my youth farewell he said turning to mak rin and the others 

though they were all going with him anatole evidently wished to make
something touching and solemn out of this address to his comrades he
spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest slightly swayed
one leg 

 all take glasses you too balag well comrades and friends of my
youth we ve had our fling and lived and reveled eh and now when
shall we meet again i am going abroad we have had a good time now
farewell lads to our health hurrah he cried and emptying his
glass flung it on the floor 

 to your health said balag who also emptied his glass and wiped his
mouth with his handkerchief 

mak rin embraced anatole with tears in his eyes 

 ah prince how sorry i am to part from you 

 let s go let s go cried anatole 

balag was about to leave the room 

 no stop said anatole shut the door we have first to sit down 
that s the way 

they shut the door and all sat down 

 now quick march lads said anatole rising 

joseph his valet handed him his sabretache and saber and they all
went out into the vestibule 

 and where s the fur cloak asked d lokhov hey ign tka go to
matr na matr vna and ask her for the sable cloak i have heard what
elopements are like continued d lokhov with a wink why she ll rush
out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing if you delay
at all there ll be tears and papa and mamma and she s frozen in a
minute and must go back but you wrap the fur cloak round her first thing
and carry her to the sleigh 

the valet brought a woman s fox lined cloak 

 fool i told you the sable one hey matr na the sable he shouted so
that his voice rang far through the rooms 

a handsome slim and pale faced gypsy girl with glittering black eyes
and curly blue black hair wearing a red shawl ran out with a sable
mantle on her arm 

 here i don t grudge it take it she said evidently afraid of her
master and yet regretful of her cloak 

d lokhov without answering took the cloak threw it over matr na and
wrapped her up in it 

 that s the way said d lokhov and then so and he turned the collar
up round her head leaving only a little of the face uncovered and
then so do you see and he pushed anatole s head forward to meet the
gap left by the collar through which matr na s brilliant smile was
seen 

 well good by matr na said anatole kissing her ah my revels here
are over remember me to st shka there good by good by matr na wish
me luck 

 well prince may god give you great luck said matr na in her gypsy
accent 

two troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers were
holding the horses balag took his seat in the front one and holding
his elbows high arranged the reins deliberately anatole and d lokhov
got in with him mak rin khv stikov and a valet seated themselves in
the other sleigh 

 well are you ready asked balag 

 go he cried twisting the reins round his hands and the troyka tore
down the nik tski boulevard 

 tproo get out of the way hi tproo the shouting of balag 
and of the sturdy young fellow seated on the box was all that could
be heard on the arb t square the troyka caught against a carriage 
something cracked shouts were heard and the troyka flew along the
arb t street 

after taking a turn along the podnov nski boulevard balag began to
rein in and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old kony sheny
street 

the young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and anatole
and d lokhov went along the pavement when they reached the gate
d lokhov whistled the whistle was answered and a maidservant ran out 

 come into the courtyard or you ll be seen she ll come out directly 
said she 

d lokhov stayed by the gate anatole followed the maid into the
courtyard turned the corner and ran up into the porch 

he was met by gabriel m rya dm trievna s gigantic footman 

 come to the mistress please said the footman in his deep bass 
intercepting any retreat 

 to what mistress who are you asked anatole in a breathless whisper 

 kindly step in my orders are to bring you in 

 kur gin come back shouted d lokhov betrayed back 

d lokhov after anatole entered had remained at the wicket gate and was
struggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it with a last
desperate effort d lokhov pushed the porter aside and when anatole ran
back seized him by the arm pulled him through the wicket and ran back
with him to the troyka 





chapter xviii

m rya dm trievna having found s nya weeping in the corridor made her
confess everything and intercepting the note to nat sha she read it and
went into nat sha s room with it in her hand 

 you shameless good for nothing said she i won t hear a word 

pushing back nat sha who looked at her with astonished but tearless
eyes she locked her in and having given orders to the yard porter to
admit the persons who would be coming that evening but not to let them
out again and having told the footman to bring them up to her she
seated herself in the drawing room to await the abductors 

when gabriel came to inform her that the men who had come had run
away again she rose frowning and clasping her hands behind her paced
through the rooms a long time considering what she should do toward
midnight she went to nat sha s room fingering the key in her pocket 
s nya was sitting sobbing in the corridor m rya dm trievna for god s
sake let me in to her she pleaded but m rya dm trievna unlocked
the door and went in without giving her an answer disgusting 
abominable in my house horrid girl hussy i m only sorry for her
father thought she trying to restrain her wrath hard as it may
be i ll tell them all to hold their tongues and will hide it from the
count she entered the room with resolute steps nat sha lying on the
sofa her head hidden in her hands and she did not stir she was in
just the same position in which m rya dm trievna had left her 

 a nice girl very nice said m rya dm trievna arranging meetings
with lovers in my house it s no use pretending you listen when i speak
to you and m rya dm trievna touched her arm listen when i speak 
you ve disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies i d treat you
differently but i m sorry for your father so i will conceal it 

nat sha did not change her position but her whole body heaved with
noiseless convulsive sobs which choked her m rya dm trievna glanced
round at s nya and seated herself on the sofa beside nat sha 

 it s lucky for him that he escaped me but i ll find him she said in
her rough voice do you hear what i am saying or not she added 

she put her large hand under nat sha s face and turned it toward her 
both m rya dm trievna and s nya were amazed when they saw how nat sha
looked her eyes were dry and glistening her lips compressed her
cheeks sunken 

 let me be what is it to me i shall die she muttered 
wrenching herself from m rya dm trievna s hands with a vicious effort
and sinking down again into her former position 

 natalie said m rya dm trievna i wish for your good lie still 
stay like that then i won t touch you but listen i won t tell you how
guilty you are you know that yourself but when your father comes back
tomorrow what am i to tell him eh 

again nat sha s body shook with sobs 

 suppose he finds out and your brother and your betrothed 

 i have no betrothed i have refused him cried nat sha 

 that s all the same continued m rya dm trievna if they hear of
this will they let it pass he your father i know him if he
challenges him to a duel will that be all right eh 

 oh let me be why have you interfered at all why why who asked
you to shouted nat sha raising herself on the sofa and looking
malignantly at m rya dm trievna 

 but what did you want cried m rya dm trievna growing angry again 
 were you kept under lock and key who hindered his coming to the house 
why carry you off as if you were some gypsy singing girl well if he
had carried you off do you think they wouldn t have found him 
your father or brother or your betrothed and he s a scoundrel a
wretch that s a fact 

 he is better than any of you exclaimed nat sha getting up if you
hadn t interfered oh my god what is it all what is it s nya 
why go away 

and she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with which people
bewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned m rya
dm trievna was to speak again but nat sha cried out 

 go away go away you all hate and despise me and she threw herself
back on the sofa 

m rya dm trievna went on admonishing her for some time enjoining on her
that it must all be kept from her father and assuring her that nobody
would know anything about it if only nat sha herself would undertake
to forget it all and not let anyone see that something had happened 
nat sha did not reply nor did she sob any longer but she grew cold
and had a shivering fit m rya dm trievna put a pillow under her head 
covered her with two quilts and herself brought her some lime flower
water but nat sha did not respond to her 

 well let her sleep said m rya dm trievna as she went out of the room
supposing nat sha to be asleep 

but nat sha was not asleep with pale face and fixed wide open eyes she
looked straight before her all that night she did not sleep or weep and
did not speak to s nya who got up and went to her several times 

next day count rost v returned from his estate near moscow in time for
lunch as he had promised he was in very good spirits the affair with
the purchaser was going on satisfactorily and there was nothing to keep
him any longer in moscow away from the countess whom he missed m rya
dm trievna met him and told him that nat sha had been very unwell the
day before and that they had sent for the doctor but that she was
better now nat sha had not left her room that morning with compressed
and parched lips and dry fixed eyes she sat at the window uneasily
watching the people who drove past and hurriedly glancing round at
anyone who entered the room she was evidently expecting news of him and
that he would come or would write to her 

when the count came to see her she turned anxiously round at the sound
of a man s footstep and then her face resumed its cold and malevolent
expression she did not even get up to greet him what is the matter
with you my angel are you ill asked the count 

after a moment s silence nat sha answered yes ill 

in reply to the count s anxious inquiries as to why she was so dejected
and whether anything had happened to her betrothed she assured him
that nothing had happened and asked him not to worry m rya dm trievna
confirmed nat sha s assurances that nothing had happened from
the pretense of illness from his daughter s distress and by the
embarrassed faces of s nya and m rya dm trievna the count saw clearly
that something had gone wrong during his absence but it was so terrible
for him to think that anything disgraceful had happened to his beloved
daughter and he so prized his own cheerful tranquillity that he
avoided inquiries and tried to assure himself that nothing particularly
had happened and he was only dissatisfied that her indisposition
delayed their return to the country 





chapter xix

from the day his wife arrived in moscow pierre had been intending to go
away somewhere so as not to be near her soon after the rost vs came
to moscow the effect nat sha had on him made him hasten to carry out
his intention he went to tver to see joseph alex evich s widow who
had long since promised to hand over to him some papers of her deceased
husband s 

when he returned to moscow pierre was handed a letter from m rya
dm trievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great
importance relating to andrew bolk nski and his betrothed pierre had
been avoiding nat sha because it seemed to him that his feeling for her
was stronger than a married man s should be for his friend s fianc e 
yet some fate constantly threw them together 

 what can have happened and what can they want with me thought he
as he dressed to go to m rya dm trievna s if only prince andrew would
hurry up and come and marry her thought he on his way to the house 

on the tversk y boulevard a familiar voice called to him 

 pierre been back long someone shouted pierre raised his head in
a sleigh drawn by two gray trotting horses that were bespattering the
dashboard with snow anatole and his constant companion mak rin dashed
past anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of military
dandies the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver collar and his
head slightly bent his face was fresh and rosy his white plumed hat 
tilted to one side disclosed his curled and pomaded hair besprinkled
with powdery snow 

 yes indeed that s a true sage thought pierre he sees nothing
beyond the pleasure of the moment nothing troubles him and so he is
always cheerful satisfied and serene what wouldn t i give to be like
him he thought enviously 

in m rya dm trievna s anteroom the footman who helped him off with his
fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom 

when he opened the ballroom door pierre saw nat sha sitting at the
window with a thin pale and spiteful face she glanced round at him 
frowned and left the room with an expression of cold dignity 

 what has happened asked pierre entering m rya dm trievna s room 

 fine doings answered dm trievna for fifty eight years have i lived
in this world and never known anything so disgraceful 

and having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told him 
m rya dm trievna informed him that nat sha had refused prince andrew
without her parents knowledge and that the cause of this was anatole
kur gin into whose society pierre s wife had thrown her and with whom
nat sha had tried to elope during her father s absence in order to be
married secretly 

pierre raised his shoulders and listened open mouthed to what was told
him scarcely able to believe his own ears that prince andrew s
deeply loved affianced wife the same nat sha rost va who used to be so
charming should give up bolk nski for that fool anatole who was already
secretly married as pierre knew and should be so in love with him as
to agree to run away with him was something pierre could not conceive
and could not imagine 

he could not reconcile the charming impression he had of nat sha whom
he had known from a child with this new conception of her baseness 
folly and cruelty he thought of his wife they are all alike he
said to himself reflecting that he was not the only man unfortunate
enough to be tied to a bad woman but still he pitied prince andrew to
the point of tears and sympathized with his wounded pride and the more
he pitied his friend the more did he think with contempt and even with
disgust of that nat sha who had just passed him in the ballroom with
such a look of cold dignity he did not know that nat sha s soul was
overflowing with despair shame and humiliation and that it was not
her fault that her face happened to assume an expression of calm dignity
and severity 

 but how get married said pierre in answer to m rya dm trievna he
could not marry he is married 

 things get worse from hour to hour ejaculated m rya dm trievna a
nice youth what a scoundrel and she s expecting him expecting him
since yesterday she must be told then at least she won t go on
expecting him 

after hearing the details of anatole s marriage from pierre and giving
vent to her anger against anatole in words of abuse m rya dm trievna
told pierre why she had sent for him she was afraid that the count or
bolk nski who might arrive at any moment if they knew of this affair
 which she hoped to hide from them might challenge anatole to a duel 
and she therefore asked pierre to tell his brother in law in her name to
leave moscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again pierre only
now realizing the danger to the old count nicholas and prince
andrew promised to do as she wished having briefly and exactly
explained her wishes to him she let him go to the drawing room 

 mind the count knows nothing behave as if you know nothing either 
she said and i will go and tell her it is no use expecting him and
stay to dinner if you care to she called after pierre 

pierre met the old count who seemed nervous and upset that morning
nat sha had told him that she had rejected bolk nski 

 troubles troubles my dear fellow he said to pierre what troubles
one has with these girls without their mother i do so regret having
come here i will be frank with you have you heard she has broken
off her engagement without consulting anybody it s true this engagement
never was much to my liking of course he is an excellent man but
still with his father s disapproval they wouldn t have been happy and
nat sha won t lack suitors still it has been going on so long and
to take such a step without father s or mother s consent and now she s
ill and god knows what it s hard count hard to manage daughters in
their mother s absence 

pierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change the
subject but the count returned to his troubles 

s nya entered the room with an agitated face 

 nat sha is not quite well she s in her room and would like to see you 
m rya dm trievna is with her and she too asks you to come 

 yes you are a great friend of bolk nski s no doubt she wants to send
him a message said the count oh dear oh dear how happy it all
was 

and clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the
room 

when m rya dm trievna told nat sha that anatole was married nat sha
did not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by pierre
himself s nya told pierre this as she led him along the corridor to
nat sha s room 

nat sha pale and stern was sitting beside m rya dm trievna and her
eyes glittering feverishly met pierre with a questioning look the
moment he entered she did not smile or nod but only gazed fixedly at
him and her look asked only one thing was he a friend or like the
others an enemy in regard to anatole as for pierre he evidently did
not exist for her 

 he knows all about it said m rya dm trievna pointing to pierre and
addressing nat sha let him tell you whether i have told the truth 

nat sha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded animal
looks at the approaching dogs and sportsmen 

 nat lya ilyn chna pierre began dropping his eyes with a feeling of
pity for her and loathing for the thing he had to do whether it is
true or not should make no difference to you because 

 then it is not true that he s married 

 yes it is true 

 has he been married long she asked on your honor 

pierre gave his word of honor 

 is he still here she asked quickly 

 yes i have just seen him 

she was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her hands that
they should leave her alone 





chapter xx

pierre did not stay for dinner but left the room and went away at once 
he drove through the town seeking anatole kur gin at the thought of
whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a difficulty in
breathing he was not at the ice hills nor at the gypsies nor at
komoneno s pierre drove to the club in the club all was going on as
usual the members who were assembling for dinner were sitting about
in groups they greeted pierre and spoke of the town news the footman
having greeted him knowing his habits and his acquaintances told him
there was a place left for him in the small dining room and that prince
michael zakh rych was in the library but paul timof evich had not yet
arrived one of pierre s acquaintances while they were talking about
the weather asked if he had heard of kur gin s abduction of rost va
which was talked of in the town and was it true pierre laughed and
said it was nonsense for he had just come from the rost vs he asked
everyone about anatole one man told him he had not come yet and
another that he was coming to dinner pierre felt it strange to see this
calm indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in his
soul he paced through the ballroom waited till everyone had come and
as anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home 

anatole for whom pierre was looking dined that day with d lokhov 
consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair it seemed to
him essential to see nat sha in the evening he drove to his sister s
to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting when pierre returned home
after vainly hunting all over moscow his valet informed him that prince
anatole was with the countess the countess drawing room was full of
guests 

pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his
return at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever entered
the drawing room and seeing anatole went up to him 

 ah pierre said the countess going up to her husband you don t know
what a plight our anatole 

she stopped seeing in the forward thrust of her husband s head in his
glowing eyes and his resolute gait the terrible indications of that
rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his
duel with d lokhov 

 where you are there is vice and evil said pierre to his wife 
 anatole come with me i must speak to you he added in french 

anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively ready to
follow pierre pierre taking him by the arm pulled him toward himself
and was leading him from the room 

 if you allow yourself in my drawing room whispered h l ne but
pierre did not reply and went out of the room 

anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed
anxiety 

having entered his study pierre closed the door and addressed anatole
without looking at him 

 you promised countess rost va to marry her and were about to elope with
her is that so 

 mon cher answered anatole their whole conversation was in french 
 i don t consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that
tone 

pierre s face already pale became distorted by fury he seized anatole
by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from side
to side till anatole s face showed a sufficient degree of terror 

 when i tell you that i must talk to you repeated pierre 

 come now this is stupid what said anatole fingering a button of
his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth 

 you re a scoundrel and a blackguard and i don t know what deprives
me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this said pierre 
expressing himself so artificially because he was talking french 

he took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly but at once put
it back in its place 

 did you promise to marry her 

 i i didn t think of it i never promised because 

pierre interrupted him 

 have you any letters of hers any letters he said moving toward
anatole 

anatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocket
and drew out his pocketbook 

pierre took the letter anatole handed him and pushing aside a table
that stood in his way threw himself on the sofa 

 i shan t be violent don t be afraid said pierre in answer to a
frightened gesture of anatole s first the letters said he as if
repeating a lesson to himself secondly he continued after a short
pause again rising and again pacing the room tomorrow you must get
out of moscow 

 but how can i 

 thirdly pierre continued without listening to him you must never
breathe a word of what has passed between you and countess rost va 
i know i can t prevent your doing so but if you have a spark of
conscience pierre paced the room several times in silence 

anatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips 

 after all you must understand that besides your pleasure there is such
a thing as other people s happiness and peace and that you are ruining
a whole life for the sake of amusing yourself amuse yourself with women
like my wife with them you are within your rights for they know what
you want of them they are armed against you by the same experience
of debauchery but to promise a maid to marry her to deceive to
kidnap don t you understand that it is as mean as beating an old man
or a child 

pierre paused and looked at anatole no longer with an angry but with a
questioning look 

 i don t know about that eh said anatole growing more confident as
pierre mastered his wrath i don t know that and don t want to he
said not looking at pierre and with a slight tremor of his lower jaw 
 but you have used such words to me mean and so on which as a man of
honor i can t allow anyone to use 

pierre glanced at him with amazement unable to understand what he
wanted 

 though it was t te t te anatole continued still i can t 

 is it satisfaction you want said pierre ironically 

 you could at least take back your words what if you want me to do as
you wish eh 

 i take them back i take them back said pierre and i ask you to
forgive me pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button and if
you require money for your journey 

anatole smiled the expression of that base and cringing smile which
pierre knew so well in his wife revolted him 

 oh vile and heartless brood he exclaimed and left the room 

next day anatole left for petersburg 





chapter xxi

pierre drove to m rya dm trievna s to tell her of the fulfillment of her
wish that kur gin should be banished from moscow the whole house was in
a state of alarm and commotion nat sha was very ill having as m rya
dm trievna told him in secret poisoned herself the night after she had
been told that anatole was married with some arsenic she had stealthily
procured after swallowing a little she had been so frightened that she
woke s nya and told her what she had done the necessary antidotes had
been administered in time and she was now out of danger though still so
weak that it was out of the question to move her to the country and
so the countess had been sent for pierre saw the distracted count and
s nya who had a tear stained face but he could not see nat sha 

pierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip about
the attempted abduction of rost va he resolutely denied these
rumors assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his
brother in law had proposed to her and been refused it seemed to
pierre that it was his duty to conceal the whole affair and re establish
nat sha s reputation 

he was awaiting prince andrew s return with dread and went every day to
the old prince s for news of him 

old prince bolk nski heard all the rumors current in the town from
mademoiselle bourienne and had read the note to princess mary in which
nat sha had broken off her engagement he seemed in better spirits than
usual and awaited his son with great impatience 

some days after anatole s departure pierre received a note from prince
andrew informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see him 

as soon as he reached moscow prince andrew had received from his
father nat sha s note to princess mary breaking off her engagement
 mademoiselle bourienne had purloined it from princess mary and given
it to the old prince and he heard from him the story of nat sha s
elopement with additions 

prince andrew had arrived in the evening and pierre came to see him next
morning pierre expected to find prince andrew in almost the same state
as nat sha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room
to hear him in the study talking in a loud animated voice about some
intrigue going on in petersburg the old prince s voice and another now
and then interrupted him princess mary came out to meet pierre she
sighed looking toward the door of the room where prince andrew was 
evidently intending to express her sympathy with his sorrow but pierre
saw by her face that she was glad both at what had happened and at the
way her brother had taken the news of nat sha s faithlessness 

 he says he expected it she remarked i know his pride will not let
him express his feelings but still he has taken it better far better 
than i expected evidently it had to be 

 but is it possible that all is really ended asked pierre 

princess mary looked at him with astonishment she did not understand
how he could ask such a question pierre went into the study prince
andrew greatly changed and plainly in better health but with a fresh
horizontal wrinkle between his brows stood in civilian dress facing
his father and prince meshch rski warmly disputing and vigorously
gesticulating the conversation was about sper nski the news of whose
sudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached moscow 

 now he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him
a month ago prince andrew was saying and by those who were unable to
understand his aims to judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw on
him all the blame of other men s mistakes is very easy but i maintain
that if anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done by
him by him alone 

he paused at the sight of pierre his face quivered and immediately
assumed a vindictive expression 

 posterity will do him justice he concluded and at once turned to
pierre 

 well how are you still getting stouter he said with animation but
the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened yes i am well he said in
answer to pierre s question and smiled 

to pierre that smile said plainly i am well but my health is now of
no use to anyone 

after a few words to pierre about the awful roads from the polish
frontier about people he had met in switzerland who knew pierre and
about m dessalles whom he had brought from abroad to be his son s
tutor prince andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about
sper nski which was still going on between the two old men 

 if there were treason or proofs of secret relations with napoleon 
they would have been made public he said with warmth and haste i do
not and never did like sper nski personally but i like justice 

pierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too
familiar to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters
in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate 
when prince meshch rski had left prince andrew took pierre s arm and
asked him into the room that had been assigned him a bed had been made
up there and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about prince
andrew went to one and took out a small casket from which he drew a
packet wrapped in paper he did it all silently and very quickly he
stood up and coughed his face was gloomy and his lips compressed 

 forgive me for troubling you 

pierre saw that prince andrew was going to speak of nat sha and his
broad face expressed pity and sympathy this expression irritated prince
andrew and in a determined ringing and unpleasant tone he continued 

 i have received a refusal from countess rost va and have heard reports
of your brother in law having sought her hand or something of that
kind is that true 

 both true and untrue pierre began but prince andrew interrupted him 

 here are her letters and her portrait said he 

he took the packet from the table and handed it to pierre 

 give this to the countess if you see her 

 she is very ill said pierre 

 then she is here still said prince andrew and prince kur gin he
added quickly 

 he left long ago she has been at death s door 

 i much regret her illness said prince andrew and he smiled like his
father coldly maliciously and unpleasantly 

 so monsieur kur gin has not honored countess rost va with his hand 
said prince andrew and he snorted several times 

 he could not marry for he was married already said pierre 

prince andrew laughed disagreeably again reminding one of his father 

 and where is your brother in law now if i may ask he said 

 he has gone to peters but i don t know said pierre 

 well it doesn t matter said prince andrew tell countess rost va
that she was and is perfectly free and that i wish her all that is
good 

pierre took the packet prince andrew as if trying to remember whether
he had something more to say or waiting to see if pierre would say
anything looked fixedly at him 

 i say do you remember our discussion in petersburg asked pierre 
 about 

 yes returned prince andrew hastily i said that a fallen woman
should be forgiven but i didn t say i could forgive her i can t 

 but can this be compared said pierre 

prince andrew interrupted him and cried sharply yes ask her hand
again be magnanimous and so on yes that would be very noble but
i am unable to follow in that gentleman s footsteps if you wish to be
my friend never speak to me of that of all that well good by so
you ll give her the packet 

pierre left the room and went to the old prince and princess mary 

the old man seemed livelier than usual princess mary was the same as
always but beneath her sympathy for her brother pierre noticed her
satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off looking at them
pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the
rost vs and that it was impossible in their presence even to mention
the name of her who could give up prince andrew for anyone else 

at dinner the talk turned on the war the approach of which was becoming
evident prince andrew talked incessantly arguing now with his father 
now with the swiss tutor dessalles and showing an unnatural animation 
the cause of which pierre so well understood 





chapter xxii

that same evening pierre went to the rost vs to fulfill the commission
entrusted to him nat sha was in bed the count at the club and pierre 
after giving the letters to s nya went to m rya dm trievna who was
interested to know how prince andrew had taken the news ten minutes
later s nya came to m rya dm trievna 

 nat sha insists on seeing count peter kir lovich said she 

 but how are we to take him up to her the room there has not been
tidied up 

 no she has dressed and gone into the drawing room said s nya 

m rya dm trievna only shrugged her shoulders 

 when will her mother come she has worried me to death now mind don t
tell her everything said she to pierre one hasn t the heart to scold
her she is so much to be pitied so much to be pitied 

nat sha was standing in the middle of the drawing room emaciated with
a pale set face but not at all shamefaced as pierre expected to find
her when he appeared at the door she grew flurried evidently undecided
whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up 

pierre hastened to her he thought she would give him her hand as
usual but she stepping up to him stopped breathing heavily her arms
hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she
went to the middle of the ballroom to sing but with quite a different
expression of face 

 peter kir lovich she began rapidly prince bolk nski was your
friend is your friend she corrected herself it seemed to her that
everything that had once been must now be different he told me once
to apply to you 

pierre sniffed as he looked at her but did not speak till then he had
reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her but he now felt so
sorry for her that there was no room in his soul for reproach 

 he is here now tell him to for forgive me she stopped and
breathed still more quickly but did not shed tears 

 yes i will tell him answered pierre but 

he did not know what to say 

nat sha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think she
had meant 

 no i know all is over she said hurriedly no that can never be 
i m only tormented by the wrong i have done him tell him only that i
beg him to forgive forgive forgive me for everything 

she trembled all over and sat down on a chair 

a sense of pity he had never before known overflowed pierre s heart 

 i will tell him i will tell him everything once more said pierre 
 but i should like to know one thing 

 know what nat sha s eyes asked 

 i should like to know did you love pierre did not know how to
refer to anatole and flushed at the thought of him did you love that
bad man 

 don t call him bad said nat sha but i don t know don t know at
all 

she began to cry and a still greater sense of pity tenderness and love
welled up in pierre he felt the tears trickle under his spectacles and
hoped they would not be noticed 

 we won t speak of it any more my dear said pierre and his gentle 
cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to nat sha 

 we won t speak of it my dear i ll tell him everything but one thing
i beg of you consider me your friend and if you want help advice 
or simply to open your heart to someone not now but when your mind is
clearer think of me he took her hand and kissed it i shall be happy
if it s in my power 

pierre grew confused 

 don t speak to me like that i am not worth it exclaimed nat sha and
turned to leave the room but pierre held her hand 

he knew he had something more to say to her but when he said it he was
amazed at his own words 

 stop stop you have your whole life before you said he to her 

 before me no all is over for me she replied with shame and
self abasement 

 all over he repeated if i were not myself but the handsomest 
cleverest and best man in the world and were free i would this moment
ask on my knees for your hand and your love 

for the first time for many days nat sha wept tears of gratitude and
tenderness and glancing at pierre she went out of the room 

pierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom restraining
tears of tenderness and joy that choked him and without finding the
sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his sleigh 

 where to now your excellency asked the coachman 

 where to pierre asked himself where can i go now surely not to the
club or to pay calls all men seemed so pitiful so poor in comparison
with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced in comparison
with that softened grateful last look she had given him through her
tears 

 home said pierre and despite twenty two degrees of frost fahrenheit
he threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and inhaled the
air with joy 

it was clear and frosty above the dirty ill lit streets above the
black roofs stretched the dark starry sky only looking up at the sky
did pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane
things compared with the heights to which his soul had just been raised 
at the entrance to the arb t square an immense expanse of dark starry
sky presented itself to his eyes almost in the center of it above the
prech stenka boulevard surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars
but distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth its white
light and its long uplifted tail shone the enormous and brilliant
comet of 1812 the comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes
and the end of the world in pierre however that comet with its long
luminous tail aroused no feeling of fear on the contrary he gazed
joyfully his eyes moist with tears at this bright comet which having
traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable
space seemed suddenly like an arrow piercing the earth to remain
fixed in a chosen spot vigorously holding its tail erect shining and
displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars it
seemed to pierre that this comet fully responded to what was passing in
his own softened and uplifted soul now blossoming into a new life 





book nine 1812





chapter i

from the close of the year 1811 intensified arming and concentrating of
the forces of western europe began and in 1812 these forces millions
of men reckoning those transporting and feeding the army moved from the
west eastwards to the russian frontier toward which since 1811 russian
forces had been similarly drawn on the twelfth of june 1812 the
forces of western europe crossed the russian frontier and war began 
that is an event took place opposed to human reason and to human
nature millions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerable
crimes frauds treacheries thefts forgeries issues of false money 
burglaries incendiarisms and murders as in whole centuries are not
recorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world but which
those who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimes 

what produced this extraordinary occurrence what were its causes the
historians tell us with na ve assurance that its causes were the wrongs
inflicted on the duke of oldenburg the nonobservance of the continental
system the ambition of napoleon the firmness of alexander the
mistakes of the diplomatists and so on 

consequently it would only have been necessary for metternich 
rumy ntsev or talleyrand between a levee and an evening party to have
taken proper pains and written a more adroit note or for napoleon to
have written to alexander my respected brother i consent to restore
the duchy to the duke of oldenburg and there would have been no war 

we can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries 
it naturally seemed to napoleon that the war was caused by england s
intrigues as in fact he said on the island of st helena it naturally
seemed to members of the english parliament that the cause of the war
was napoleon s ambition to the duke of oldenburg that the cause of the
war was the violence done to him to businessmen that the cause of the
war was the continental system which was ruining europe to the generals
and old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of
giving them employment to the legitimists of that day that it was the
need of re establishing les bons principes and to the diplomatists of
that time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between
russia and austria in 1809 had not been sufficiently well concealed
from napoleon and from the awkward wording of memorandum no 178 it
is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of other
reasons the number depending on the endless diversity of points
of view presented themselves to the men of that day but to us to
posterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and
perceive its plain and terrible meaning these causes seem insufficient 
to us it is incomprehensible that millions of christian men killed and
tortured each other either because napoleon was ambitious or alexander
was firm or because england s policy was astute or the duke of
oldenburg wronged we cannot grasp what connection such circumstances
have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence why because the
duke was wronged thousands of men from the other side of europe killed
and ruined the people of smol nsk and moscow and were killed by them 

to us their descendants who are not historians and are not carried
away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event
with unclouded common sense an incalculable number of causes present
themselves the deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of
them we find and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears
to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance
compared to the magnitude of the events and by its impotence apart
from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes to occasion the
event to us the wish or objection of this or that french corporal to
serve a second term appears as much a cause as napoleon s refusal to
withdraw his troops beyond the vistula and to restore the duchy of
oldenburg for had he not wished to serve and had a second a third 
and a thousandth corporal and private also refused there would have
been so many less men in napoleon s army and the war could not have
occurred 

had napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw
beyond the vistula and not ordered his troops to advance there would
have been no war but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second
term then also there could have been no war nor could there have been
a war had there been no english intrigues and no duke of oldenburg and
had alexander not felt insulted and had there not been an autocratic
government in russia or a revolution in france and a subsequent
dictatorship and empire or all the things that produced the french
revolution and so on without each of these causes nothing could have
happened so all these causes myriads of causes coincided to bring it
about and so there was no one cause for that occurrence but it had
to occur because it had to millions of men renouncing their human
feelings and reason had to go from west to east to slay their fellows 
just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east
to the west slaying their fellows 

the actions of napoleon and alexander on whose words the event seemed
to hang were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was
drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription this could not be
otherwise for in order that the will of napoleon and alexander on whom
the event seemed to depend should be carried out the concurrence of
innumerable circumstances was needed without anyone of which the event
could not have taken place it was necessary that millions of men in
whose hands lay the real power the soldiers who fired or transported
provisions and guns should consent to carry out the will of these weak
individuals and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number
of diverse and complex causes 

we are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of irrational
events that is to say events the reasonableness of which we do
not understand the more we try to explain such events in history
reasonably the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become to
us 

each man lives for himself using his freedom to attain his personal
aims and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain from
doing this or that action but as soon as he has done it that action
performed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and belongs to
history in which it has not a free but a predestined significance 

there are two sides to the life of every man his individual life which
is the more free the more abstract its interests and his elemental hive
life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for him 

man lives consciously for himself but is an unconscious instrument in
the attainment of the historic universal aims of humanity a deed done
is irrevocable and its result coinciding in time with the actions of
millions of other men assumes an historic significance the higher a man
stands on the social ladder the more people he is connected with
and the more power he has over others the more evident is the
predestination and inevitability of his every action 

 the king s heart is in the hands of the lord 

a king is history s slave 

history that is the unconscious general hive life of mankind uses
every moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposes 

though napoleon at that time in 1812 was more convinced than ever that
it depended on him verser ou ne pas verser le sang de ses peuples
 as alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote him he had never
been so much in the grip of inevitable laws which compelled him while
thinking that he was acting on his own volition to perform for the hive
life that is to say for history whatever had to be performed 

 to shed or not to shed the blood of his peoples 


the people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men and
by the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and
co ordinated to produce that movement and war reproaches for the
nonobservance of the continental system the duke of oldenburg s
wrongs the movement of troops into prussia undertaken as it seemed to
napoleon only for the purpose of securing an armed peace the
french emperor s love and habit of war coinciding with his people s
inclinations allurement by the grandeur of the preparations and the
expenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining advantages
to compensate for that expenditure the intoxicating honors he received
in dresden the diplomatic negotiations which in the opinion of
contemporaries were carried on with a sincere desire to attain peace 
but which only wounded the self love of both sides and millions of
other causes that adapted themselves to the event that was happening or
coincided with it 

when an apple has ripened and falls why does it fall because of its
attraction to the earth because its stalk withers because it is dried
by the sun because it grows heavier because the wind shakes it or
because the boy standing below wants to eat it 

nothing is the cause all this is only the coincidence of conditions in
which all vital organic and elemental events occur and the botanist
who finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue decays and so
forth is equally right with the child who stands under the tree and says
the apple fell because he wanted to eat it and prayed for it equally
right or wrong is he who says that napoleon went to moscow because he
wanted to and perished because alexander desired his destruction and
he who says that an undermined hill weighing a million tons fell because
the last navvy struck it for the last time with his mattock in historic
events the so called great men are labels giving names to events and
like labels they have but the smallest connection with the event itself 

every act of theirs which appears to them an act of their own will is
in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole course of
history and predestined from eternity 





chapter ii

on the twenty ninth of may napoleon left dresden where he had spent
three weeks surrounded by a court that included princes dukes kings 
and even an emperor before leaving napoleon showed favor to the
emperor kings and princes who had deserved it reprimanded the kings
and princes with whom he was dissatisfied presented pearls and diamonds
of his own that is which he had taken from other kings to the empress
of austria and having as his historian tells us tenderly embraced the
empress marie louise who regarded him as her husband though he had left
another wife in paris left her grieved by the parting which she seemed
hardly able to bear though the diplomatists still firmly believed in
the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end and though
the emperor napoleon himself wrote a letter to alexander calling him
monsieur mon fr re and sincerely assured him that he did not want war
and would always love and honor him yet he set off to join his army 
and at every station gave fresh orders to accelerate the movement of his
troops from west to east he went in a traveling coach with six horses 
surrounded by pages aides de camp and an escort along the road to
posen thorn danzig and k nigsberg at each of these towns thousands
of people met him with excitement and enthusiasm 

the army was moving from west to east and relays of six horses carried
him in the same direction on the tenth of june coming up with the
army he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on the estate of
a polish count in the vilkavisski forest 

 old style 

next day overtaking the army he went in a carriage to the niemen and 
changing into a polish uniform he drove to the riverbank in order to
select a place for the crossing 

seeing on the other side some cossacks les cosaques and the
wide spreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of moscow
 moscou la ville sainte the capital of a realm such as the scythia
into which alexander the great had marched napoleon unexpectedly and
contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations ordered an
advance and the next day his army began to cross the niemen 

early in the morning of the twelfth of june he came out of his tent 
which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the niemen and
looked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out of
the vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown across
the river the troops knowing of the emperor s presence were on the
lookout for him and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat
and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on
the hill they threw up their caps and shouted vive l empereur and
one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of the vast forest
that had concealed them and separating flowed on and on by the three
bridges to the other side 

 now we ll go into action oh when he takes it in hand himself things
get hot by heaven there he is vive l empereur so these
are the steppes of asia it s a nasty country all the same au revoir 
beauch i ll keep the best palace in moscow for you au revoir good
luck did you see the emperor vive l empereur preur if
they make me governor of india g rard i ll make you minister of
kashmir that s settled vive l empereur hurrah hurrah hurrah the
cossacks those rascals see how they run vive l empereur there he
is do you see him i ve seen him twice as i see you now the little
corporal i saw him give the cross to one of the veterans vive
l empereur came the voices of men old and young of most diverse
characters and social positions on the faces of all was one common
expression of joy at the commencement of the long expected campaign and
of rapture and devotion to the man in the gray coat who was standing on
the hill 

on the thirteenth of june a rather small thoroughbred arab horse was
brought to napoleon he mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of the
bridges over the niemen deafened continually by incessant and rapturous
acclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible
to forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting 
but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and
distracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from the
time he joined the army he rode across one of the swaying pontoon
bridges to the farther side turned sharply to the left and galloped in
the direction of k vno preceded by enraptured mounted chasseurs of the
guard who breathless with delight galloped ahead to clear a path for
him through the troops on reaching the broad river v liya he stopped
near a regiment of polish uhlans stationed by the river 

 vivat shouted the poles ecstatically breaking their ranks and
pressing against one another to see him 

napoleon looked up and down the river dismounted and sat down on a log
that lay on the bank at a mute sign from him a telescope was handed
him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run up to him 
and he gazed at the opposite bank then he became absorbed in a map laid
out on the logs without lifting his head he said something and two of
his aides de camp galloped off to the polish uhlans 

 what what did he say was heard in the ranks of the polish uhlans
when one of the aides de camp rode up to them 

the order was to find a ford and to cross the river the colonel of the
polish uhlans a handsome old man flushed and fumbling in his speech
from excitement asked the aide de camp whether he would be permitted
to swim the river with his uhlans instead of seeking a ford in evident
fear of refusal like a boy asking for permission to get on a horse he
begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the emperor s
eyes the aide de camp replied that probably the emperor would not be
displeased at this excess of zeal 

as soon as the aide de camp had said this the old mustached officer 
with happy face and sparkling eyes raised his saber shouted vivat 
and commanding the uhlans to follow him spurred his horse and galloped
into the river he gave an angry thrust to his horse which had grown
restive under him and plunged into the water heading for the deepest
part where the current was swift hundreds of uhlans galloped in after
him it was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of the
stream and the uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off their
horses some of the horses were drowned and some of the men the others
tried to swim on some in the saddle and some clinging to their horses 
manes they tried to make their way forward to the opposite bank and 
though there was a ford one third of a mile away were proud that they
were swimming and drowning in this river under the eyes of the man who
sat on the log and was not even looking at what they were doing when
the aide de camp having returned and choosing an opportune moment 
ventured to draw the emperor s attention to the devotion of the poles
to his person the little man in the gray overcoat got up and having
summoned berthier began pacing up and down the bank with him giving
him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the
drowning uhlans who distracted his attention 

for him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of
the world from africa to the steppes of muscovy alike was enough to
dumfound people and impel them to insane self oblivion he called for
his horse and rode to his quarters 

some forty uhlans were drowned in the river though boats were sent to
their assistance the majority struggled back to the bank from which
they had started the colonel and some of his men got across and with
difficulty clambered out on the further bank and as soon as they had
got out in their soaked and streaming clothes they shouted vivat 
and looked ecstatically at the spot where napoleon had been but where he
no longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy 

that evening between issuing one order that the forged russian paper
money prepared for use in russia should be delivered as quickly as
possible and another that a saxon should be shot on whom a letter
containing information about the orders to the french army had been
found napoleon also gave instructions that the polish colonel who
had needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled in the l gion
d honneur of which napoleon was himself the head 

quos vult perdere dementat 

 those whom god wishes to destroy he drives mad 





chapter iii

the emperor of russia had meanwhile been in v lna for more than a
month reviewing troops and holding maneuvers nothing was ready for the
war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the emperor had come
from petersburg there was no general plan of action the vacillation
between the various plans that were proposed had even increased after
the emperor had been at headquarters for a month each of the three
armies had its own commander in chief but there was no supreme
commander of all the forces and the emperor did not assume that
responsibility himself 

the longer the emperor remained in v lna the less did everybody tired of
waiting prepare for the war all the efforts of those who surrounded the
sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his time pleasantly
and forget that war was impending 

in june after many balls and fetes given by the polish magnates by the
courtiers and by the emperor himself it occurred to one of the polish
aides de camp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be given for
the emperor by his aides de camp this idea was eagerly received 
the emperor gave his consent the aides de camp collected money by
subscription the lady who was thought to be most pleasing to the
emperor was invited to act as hostess count bennigsen being a
landowner in the v lna province offered his country house for the fete 
and the thirteenth of june was fixed for a ball dinner regatta and
fireworks at zakret count bennigsen s country seat 

the very day that napoleon issued the order to cross the niemen and
his vanguard driving off the cossacks crossed the russian frontier 
alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by his
aides de camp at bennigsen s country house 

it was a gay and brilliant fete connoisseurs of such matters declared
that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one place 
countess bez khova was present among other russian ladies who had
followed the sovereign from petersburg to v lna and eclipsed the refined
polish ladies by her massive so called russian type of beauty the
emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance 

bor s drubetsk y having left his wife in moscow and being for the
present en gar on as he phrased it was also there and though not an
aide de camp had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses bor s
was now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought
patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of his
own age he was meeting h l ne in v lna after not having seen her for
a long time and did not recall the past but as h l ne was enjoying
the favors of a very important personage and bor s had only recently
married they met as good friends of long standing 

at midnight dancing was still going on h l ne not having a suitable
partner herself offered to dance the mazurka with bor s they were the
third couple bor s coolly looking at h l ne s dazzling bare shoulders
which emerged from a dark gold embroidered gauze gown talked to her
of old acquaintances and at the same time unaware of it himself and
unnoticed by others never for an instant ceased to observe the emperor
who was in the same room the emperor was not dancing he stood in the
doorway stopping now one pair and now another with gracious words which
he alone knew how to utter 

as the mazurka began bor s saw that adjutant general balash v one of
those in closest attendance on the emperor went up to him and contrary
to court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to a polish
lady having finished speaking to her the emperor looked inquiringly
at balash v and evidently understanding that he only acted thus because
there were important reasons for so doing nodded slightly to the lady
and turned to him hardly had balash v begun to speak before a look of
amazement appeared on the emperor s face he took balash v by the arm
and crossed the room with him unconsciously clearing a path seven
yards wide as the people on both sides made way for him bor s noticed
arakch ev s excited face when the sovereign went out with balash v 
arakch ev looked at the emperor from under his brow and sniffing with
his red nose stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the emperor
to address him bor s understood that arakch ev envied balash v and
was displeased that evidently important news had reached the emperor
otherwise than through himself 

but the emperor and balash v passed out into the illuminated garden
without noticing arakch ev who holding his sword and glancing
wrathfully around followed some twenty paces behind them 

all the time bor s was going through the figures of the mazurka he was
worried by the question of what news balash v had brought and how he
could find it out before others in the figure in which he had to choose
two ladies he whispered to h l ne that he meant to choose countess
potocka who he thought had gone out onto the veranda and glided over
the parquet to the door opening into the garden where seeing balash v
and the emperor returning to the veranda he stood still they were
moving toward the door bor s fluttering as if he had not had time to
withdraw respectfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed head 

the emperor with the agitation of one who has been personally
affronted was finishing with these words 

 to enter russia without declaring war i will not make peace as long as
a single armed enemy remains in my country it seemed to bor s that it
gave the emperor pleasure to utter these words he was satisfied with
the form in which he had expressed his thoughts but displeased that
bor s had overheard it 

 let no one know of it the emperor added with a frown 

bor s understood that this was meant for him and closing his eyes 
slightly bowed his head the emperor re entered the ballroom and
remained there about another half hour 

bor s was thus the first to learn the news that the french army had
crossed the niemen and thanks to this was able to show certain
important personages that much that was concealed from others was
usually known to him and by this means he rose higher in their
estimation 


the unexpected news of the french having crossed the niemen was
particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations and at
a ball on first receiving the news under the influence of indignation
and resentment the emperor had found a phrase that pleased him fully
expressed his feelings and has since become famous on returning home
at two o clock that night he sent for his secretary shishk v and told
him to write an order to the troops and a rescript to field marshal
prince saltyk v in which he insisted on the words being inserted that
he would not make peace so long as a single armed frenchman remained on
russian soil 

next day the following letter was sent to napoleon 

monsieur mon fr re 

yesterday i learned that despite the loyalty with which i have kept
my engagements with your majesty your troops have crossed the russian
frontier and i have this moment received from petersburg a note in
which count lauriston informs me as a reason for this aggression that
your majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with me
from the time prince kur kin asked for his passports the reasons on
which the duc de bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him would
never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext for
aggression in fact the ambassador as he himself has declared was
never authorized to make that demand and as soon as i was informed of
it i let him know how much i disapproved of it and ordered him to remain
at his post if your majesty does not intend to shed the blood of our
peoples for such a misunderstanding and consents to withdraw your
troops from russian territory i will regard what has passed as not
having occurred and an understanding between us will be possible in
the contrary case your majesty i shall see myself forced to repel an
attack that nothing on my part has provoked it still depends on your
majesty to preserve humanity from the calamity of another war 

i am etc 

 signed alexander





chapter iv

at two in the morning of the fourteenth of june the emperor having
sent for balash v and read him his letter to napoleon ordered him to
take it and hand it personally to the french emperor when dispatching
balash v the emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make
peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on russian soil and told
him to transmit those words to napoleon alexander did not insert them
in his letter to napoleon because with his characteristic tact he felt
it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at
reconciliation was being made but he definitely instructed balash v to
repeat them personally to napoleon 

having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth accompanied by a
bugler and two cossacks balash v reached the french outposts at the
village of ryk nty on the russian side of the niemen by dawn there he
was stopped by french cavalry sentinels 

a french noncommissioned officer of hussars in crimson uniform and a
shaggy cap shouted to the approaching balash v to halt balash v did
not do so at once but continued to advance along the road at a walking
pace 

the noncommissioned officer frowned and muttering words of abuse 
advanced his horse s chest against balash v put his hand to his saber 
and shouted rudely at the russian general asking was he deaf that
he did not do as he was told balash v mentioned who he was the
noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about regimental
matters without looking at the russian general 

after living at the seat of the highest authority and power after
conversing with the emperor less than three hours before and in general
being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the service balash v
found it very strange here on russian soil to encounter this hostile 
and still more this disrespectful application of brute force to
himself 

the sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds the air was
fresh and dewy a herd of cattle was being driven along the road from
the village and over the fields the larks rose trilling one after
another like bubbles rising in water 

balash v looked around him awaiting the arrival of an officer from the
village the russian cossacks and bugler and the french hussars looked
silently at one another from time to time 

a french colonel of hussars who had evidently just left his bed came
riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse accompanied
by two hussars the officer the soldiers and their horses all looked
smart and well kept 

it was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full
trim almost like that of peacetime maneuvers but with a shade of
martial swagger in their clothes and a touch of the gaiety and spirit
of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign 

the french colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn but was polite and
evidently understood balash v s importance he led him past his soldiers
and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to be presented to
the emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately as the emperor s
quarters were he believed not far off 

they rode through the village of ryk nty past tethered french hussar
horses past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with
curiosity at a russian uniform and came out at the other end of the
village the colonel said that the commander of the division was a mile
and a quarter away and would receive balash v and conduct him to his
destination 

the sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure 

they had hardly ridden up a hill past a tavern before they saw a group
of horsemen coming toward them in front of the group on a black horse
with trappings that glittered in the sun rode a tall man with plumes
in his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders he wore a red
mantle and stretched his long legs forward in french fashion this man
rode toward balash v at a gallop his plumes flowing and his gems and
gold lace glittering in the bright june sunshine 

balash v was only two horses
