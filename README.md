The algorithms work, but the setup is not user friendly for outside users as the initial test plan changed alot and 
the main didn't change to add the ability to switch between tests easily.  This can be a clean up project for a later date.  
In the meantime, there are comments and commented out code that should make it understandable as to how to switch to running the 
different tests run in this project.
